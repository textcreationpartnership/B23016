            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is unquestionable that the State and Security of <hi>Britain</hi> hath stood by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course of Providence for these many years past, and that according to the improvement made to answer the intent and ends of such unusual things we may expect in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to have God either for us or against us; and as it is one of the most observed testimonies of Divine favour to a Kingdom and
<pb facs="tcp:205487:4"/>People, when such are raised on the Throne of Government, who are of as <hi>Publick a Spirit</hi> as of <hi>Relation,</hi> for the Interest of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the true Politick good and safety of such a place, with an impartial respect; so it is no less observable, that where there is an eminent design of Grace in a Saving Work to a <hi>Nation,</hi> and to prevent a desolating Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ere it break forth, how some have been in a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way excited with special Heroick Motions to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental herein, whose way and appearance for God did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the ordinary standard of Mens actings on which account there have been signal discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries given in this late time to
<pb facs="tcp:205487:4"/>
               <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> if there were a more suitable regard of the same; but as the Soveraign God hath, by an astonishing course of extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, thus made way for the Publick Settlement of this <hi>Illand,</hi> and to place on the <hi>Throne</hi> these, whose capacity to Rule might be no less conspicuous from most rare Enduements of mind, than by Regal Authority and Pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er; he hath also proportioned to <hi>Both Your Majesties,</hi> Trials, and Work of an unusual kind, and determined Your Reign in such a juncture of extraordinary try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, as needs some unusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and great assistance of Divine Counsel and Support, no less
<pb facs="tcp:205487:5"/>to stemm an Impetuous Tide of Atheism and Impiety within, and to have an awful regard to the Divine Government kept up in these times, then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear against the greatest of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries without: Yet surely if Grace may interpose for a resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring work again to these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and for a suitable answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to so eminent a season and opportunity, we might then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect such an appearance of God, as can bring forth that in a <hi>day</hi> or <hi>year,</hi> which may seem not easie to expect in an Age, and cause such Mountains, as seem most insuperable in the way hereof, to flow down at his presence.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:205487:5"/>
            <p>It's on this Subject I have spoke farther in these <hi>Papers,</hi> and if some things be not grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to many in this <hi>Day,</hi> it was not designed to please Men, or under the influence of a private Interest, but for the Truths sake, as a Minister of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to rest my Soul on his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Testimony herein.</p>
            <p>I know Your <hi>Majesties</hi> desire and delight lies more in serving the Publick good of <hi>Britain,</hi> and of all the Churches of Christ, than to hear thereof, which does serve a just restraint to speak in this <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress</hi> what is due, and more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming to witness at a distance, if
<pb facs="tcp:205487:6"/>it were not to speak in behalf of God, these singular engagements You are under to him, and for his interest and truth, beyond any <hi>Princess</hi> on the Earth, or for some Ages past upon it, and that he hath chosen to give Your <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> such a room, in a rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual manner, as <hi>on whom he hath delighted to honour,</hi> and trust the concerns of his Kingdom to; and to whom he hath given that inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the hearts of a People (who are as the sand of the Sea innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable) so as to Govern more by the attractions of love and delight, than by the extent of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Authority; and I may in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way speak, that as it was not possible ever for a Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:205487:6"/>to part from a People more highly desired and valued, than Your <hi>Majesty</hi> did from all ranks of that <hi>Illustrious State of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and,</hi> so is the same sense, and most desirable remembrance still continued, as a <hi>Witness</hi> of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine respect</hi> that in such a manner is rarely given to Princes and Rulers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> tho these <hi>Papers</hi> had, in their first rise, some respect to a more private use, yet being now made publick, wherein truths of so high a concern to this present day, and the state of the Church are offered, it did give the more confidence for a humble claim to the Patronage of so <hi>great a name.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:205487:7"/>It is now a time of great <hi>thoughts</hi> and expectation, as to the future state of the Catholick Church; and that these Promises are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near to their full height and accomplishment which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the highest glory, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Christ's visible Kingdom on the Earth, before its final tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation to its eternal and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant state in Heaven; and its much desired and hoped, that Your <hi>Majesties Reign</hi> may in a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory way,</hi> be made eminently subservient thereto; it's sure that great event of Providence will, in <hi>due time,</hi> be the best expounder of its self, and the onely <hi>wise God</hi> sees it fit to <hi>proportion</hi> our light here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and further breaking up of the
<pb facs="tcp:205487:7"/>same to what's necessary for our work and duty; but I have much wished, that the <hi>progressive course</hi> and coming of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Mediatory Kingdom</hi> under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and these more remarkable peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of its gradation, were more studied and enquired into, which should <hi>make way</hi> for a more clear <hi>Idea</hi> and <hi>Notion</hi> of the same according to that pattern given hereof in the <hi>Mount</hi> by Divine <hi>Record;</hi> which bears the same <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance</hi> to the <hi>state</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi> in its progress and ripening for Heaven by being thus changed from <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>Glory,</hi> until it come at last to that <hi>full stature</hi> and pitch which it shall have within time: this should, I humbly judge, make
<pb facs="tcp:205487:8"/>it more easie to decide, and unite these differences of judgment on this <hi>Subject,</hi> which make so great a noise, and let us see, that there can be no distinct Kingdom of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> expected here on the Earth which is yet to have a beginning, or any such thing as a <hi>Fifth Monarchy,</hi> but what onely imports the highest advance, and perfections of the <hi>Churches state within time.</hi> And I hope if these times of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and fulness thereof were in their true sense more deeply considered (which is in this <hi>Discourse,</hi> but specially in the <hi>Appendix</hi> touch'd) it might tend to a clearer discerning <hi>what watch of the night we are now in,</hi> and direct our <hi>faith,</hi> as to <hi>future
<pb facs="tcp:205487:8"/>things,</hi> the <hi>fulfilling</hi> whereof will be as an <hi>entry of the Church into a new horizon,</hi> but such where the highest discoveries of light will be of no farther extent, than the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth</hi> by a more <hi>full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> of the same, which is sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the most clear and desirable prospect we can have of future times, and that <hi>brightness</hi> which will be then before the second coming of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath been, and is my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious desire, that Your <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi> with that truly Wise and Magnanimous Prince the <hi>King,</hi> may be yet more highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in the work of Your Day, in order to so great an

            <p>
               <hi>THe Publishing of this</hi> following Discourse, <hi>had no rise, or call, from the desires or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of any, or the least Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of such a nature; but I hope it was with desire, that it might have some interest in the sevice of the Truth in such a time; it's true, what's offered in the</hi> First Part of these Papers, <hi>had a very Providential Rise in Writing of the same, and was directed for the</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Use <hi>of one, who did not take a light and transient view of the great consequence of a Christian's hope, and of his Souls venture for all Eternity herein; but did reckon the greatest interest of his joy and comfort within time, to lie in a solid rest and perswasion on the certainty of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth: It is indeed a great</hi> weight <hi>that lies thereon, when it's the interest
<pb facs="tcp:205487:10"/>of an Eternity; but it seems a rare thing for Men to know</hi> what the Christian Creed means, or to believe the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of their own Faith. <hi>The greatest</hi> contest <hi>which is now on the Earth, is</hi> betwixt God and Man, <hi>on the</hi> Testimony of his Word, <hi>as to an intire and absolute reliance thereon; and whether</hi> Humane Security <hi>on visible grounds, or the</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the God of Truth, <hi>when there is no concurrence of any sensible evidence herewith, be most prevalent and desirable to support the Mind under its greatest fears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is the</hi> special subject and intent of the following part of this Discourse, <hi>is of a very different nature, as relating wholly to the</hi> publick State of the Church, <hi>and that</hi> extraordinary administration of Providence, <hi>which hath been in this</hi> last Age; <hi>wherein some inquity hath been made, and light offered in the</hi> words of truth and soberness. <hi>It is now a time both of</hi> great fears, and of expectation and hope, <hi>in a more than ordinary way, and there is surely just cause for both; some things I must speak here, in a</hi> preliminary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,

               <hi>which may be matter of Sad thoughts and</hi> reflection. 1. <hi>Tho it is one of the most astonishing</hi> depths and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Providence about the Church, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the times of the</hi> New Testament, <hi>that</hi> great Scene <hi>which hath been of late acted on</hi> the Theatre of Britain and Ireland, <hi>with such a successive course of publick changes that have gone over the same for</hi> these 50 years past? <hi>yet, though we have thus lived in</hi> an Age of wonders, <hi>for the most part, we</hi> have not had eyes to see, <hi>or</hi> hearts to consider until this day, that one great end and design <hi>which God hath been still persuing hereby, but seems to be still as a dark riddle; as also in how eminent a manner all</hi> oppositions <hi>that have been yet made thereto, have tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their</hi> fall <hi>and</hi> breaking, <hi>who have essayed the same.</hi> 2. <hi>How notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a growing height of Atheism, Impiety, and Controlling the Design and Methods of Grace and Providence, yet hath not</hi> the hedge of Divine Protection <hi>been taken down about</hi> these Nations, <hi>without which, no humane Power or Counsel, could
<pb facs="tcp:205487:11"/>have to this day</hi> prevented a National ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; <hi>but when things oft have come to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible extremity, there hath been most observable alleviations herewith in a very surprising way.</hi> 3. <hi>But what may lie more near to a deep and serious regard, is</hi> the very sad aspects of Providence, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent signs of the time, <hi>which have such an unusual appearance in this day, if we reckon our interest now on the earth to lie more with God than with Men; it's true, things of that kind does rarely affect our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, for it's not the</hi> Voice of <hi>his Word, or Works can now have a hearing; yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven under the most tremenduous warnings from Heaven, that a door of hope hath been still kept open by new offers of Peace, and to shew,</hi> that Judgments threatned are not always decreed <hi>if there might be a meeting of God, whilst he is in the way, and</hi> some to stand up in the Gap <hi>before him, when in a more than ordinary manner it is now called for, to appear herein,</hi> that the Land be not destroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is indeed not easie to</hi> discern the times <hi>we are in, or to consider wisely the out goings of Providence towards the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:205487:11"/>Churches of Britain <hi>this day; &amp; there are</hi> two things <hi>especially, that may be matter of great thoughts, for being clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; the</hi> one <hi>is that after such an eminent appearance of a Divine concurrence in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful events, and to a clearing of our</hi> Skie, <hi>how quickly a surprising darkness falleth down in such a manner, as</hi> Judgment and Mercy seem to keep an equal pace, by down-casting, and up-rising; <hi>but though the onely wise God sees it oft fit to hide his work when it's nearest, to some great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance hereof, yet is it now time to</hi> hear, <hi>ere it be too late, when</hi> judgment <hi>speaks once, and again, for a Peoples taking the same to heart; and that he does thus hold his hand, even when it's lifted up to strike; yea, when in so different a manner he warns, it may be judged, there is some great and extraordinary work then on a very near approach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But there is a</hi> II<seg rend="sup">d</seg>
               <hi>thing which I doubt not will most affect Mens Spirits this day, with serious thoughts,</hi> to know on what side the scale may fall, in the decisions of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as to the Publick State, <hi>&amp; what</hi> shall
<pb facs="tcp:205487:12"/>be the end of all these wonders; <hi>tho it were well if</hi> present duty <hi>more than</hi> fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events <hi>were the subject of our thoughts, when we know</hi> who holds the ballance <hi>in his own hand; and it is sure, if light were more purely, and with a humble spirit sought after, we are not left to a</hi> doubtful judgment <hi>about the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state and destiny of the</hi> Church; <hi>I hope also in such a day there are found, who in a more than ordinary way, may be laid near to know the Counsel of God,</hi> by that promised Unction of his Spirit: <hi>I mean such onely, who does prefer a</hi> Sanctifying Work <hi>on their Soul, to the most</hi> extraordinary discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>of this kind, and</hi> knows no other light, but in the way of revealed Truth; <hi>but on a Subject of such concern (as I have desired humbly to offer light in the ensuing Discourse) so shall but speak a few words farther, for a safe Judgment, and</hi> directing of our faith herein. 1. <hi>That</hi> the <hi>strangest</hi> events of Providence, <hi>in this time, must undoubtedly be</hi> concentrick <hi>with</hi> that one great design of God, <hi>which
<pb facs="tcp:205487:12"/>he is now accomplishing, and its our being so much in the dark here, why we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand so little how all these</hi> mutations <hi>tend, and by an irresistable conduct are directed, to</hi> prepare the way of the Lord herein. 2. <hi>How it cannot possibly be judged, but that</hi> this growing Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie of the Gentile Church, <hi>now in the most</hi> purely reformed part thereof, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Prostestant Profession, must have some</hi> extraordinary mark of Divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>set thereto; and as the</hi> first times of the Gentiles <hi>were the</hi> purest and best times, <hi>so is the</hi> last period <hi>now so nearly hastning, like to be the</hi> worst, <hi>and most fatal part thereof; yea, the sad degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy every where of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>seems to be coming to that height, as the Glory of Divine Justice, will be concerned</hi> to cut off once their visible priviledges, before their Restauration again; <hi>and by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent tender of Grace, upon such a</hi> forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>of the same, to give a</hi> new grant, and holding <hi>of their right, but such as shall be no more in a distinct and separate state, but a new</hi> entry <hi>and</hi> betrothing
<pb facs="tcp:205487:13"/>of them, <hi>as a part of</hi> Christ's Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Kingdom, <hi>with the</hi> Converted Jews; <hi>whose love then to him will be in such a fervor and flame, as to revive that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and first love of the</hi> Gentiles; <hi>and its until then, we are, I humbly judge, not to expect any farther</hi> conversion of the dark Nations; <hi>yea that it is with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal close of these</hi> Times, <hi>the</hi> Ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Clades, of the Reformed Churches, <hi>and that</hi> Third Woe, <hi>foretold under</hi> the Last Trumper, <hi>seems to take place, and have their proper room, in the</hi> great frame of Providence, <hi>which may be</hi> as a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night hour of darkness, when it is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to the dawning.</p>

            <p n="1">1. That a Christian should once make it such a <hi>proper and solemn</hi> business, and work by it self, to attain a solid founding, and settlement of their <hi>faith on the truth,</hi> and to sist his soul in such a manner, as if he were then to enter on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian profession, without respect to <hi>example, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,</hi> or influence of any humane authority, or whatever any external motives could have weight herein, since in a case of that high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern men should in the greatest recess and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of spirit, have some distinct special time, such as may be matter after of sweet reflexion to them, how they did then prove themselves, with respect to so high and <hi>discriminating a profession,</hi> from the residue of the world, and did thus with full inward consent join in with the truth <hi>purely on its own evidence,</hi> as though there were none of that profession in the bounds and place they lived in.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:205487:17"/>this day, where even under a sense of the law and dictates of nature such a sight were enough to expose the very name, and form of Religion, to be just matter of abhorrence, and to be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est reproach of mankind, and thus see whither so brutish, and horrid a thing could ever claim a reception either on the <hi>purity</hi> of its <hi>rule,</hi> or any <hi>internal evidence of truth,</hi> or possible <hi>consistence</hi> with its self; so that to have no sense or beleef of the glorious being of God, is not worse, or more dreadful, then to have the highest contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, and affront, thus put on the <hi>divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and which tends rather to justify <hi>Atheism.</hi> This enquiry were it suitably improven could not but render that <hi>dilemma</hi> unansuerable, either a <hi>Christian</hi> or of no Religion at all; either that which we enjoy according to the <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> of the Christian faith, or else an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>nullity</hi> as to all Religion, and that no such sacred thing had a being on the earth.</p>
            <p>INQUIRY II. But as it is not possible to hold by the truth of a <hi>Godhead</hi> or to have any trew en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiment of Religion, without a further and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable progresse to the <hi>Christian Faith;</hi> so must the first entry hereof be on the <hi>old Testament,</hi> and by a necessar result upon this inquiry, if the God of truth gave such a <hi>promise of a redeemer to mankind</hi> after the <hi>fall,</hi> and that on this great assurance, the faith of the ancient Church did entirly rest; that so <hi>glorious a person as the Messias
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205487:18"/>should come, and be anointed to that work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemingman,</hi> and bringing him again to God; since this must be first cleared, and our faith fixed on the same ere we can enter on any enjoiment of the <hi>Ghospel,</hi> for the faith of the new Testament, is not attainable else, but in such an <hi>order</hi> and settlement of our faith in <hi>the old,</hi> and hath ane absolute dependance on the same; wherein the weight of this enquiry lyes 1.

To see how high a value, and account God put upon that one <hi>promise,</hi> by so long a delay, and procrastination of the same, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:205487:18"/>worthy of the Churches waiting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the same, <hi>for</hi> 4000. <hi>Years.</hi> 5. This enquiry must lye here, to see the first <hi>entry of the Christian Faith</hi> on the world in its <hi>precise time, and date,</hi> and how such a light did not shine on <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the state of perfection, whilst they stood in a state of tryal upon a perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their God, but with the falling doun of that dismal night of there fall, did the glory of this light first dawn (that there might be no utter darkness in the state of <hi>mankind</hi> as in that of the <hi>fallen angels,</hi>) whereby the final condemnatory sentence on the one, and releef for the other were made known, and promulgate together, and the room of the <hi>first Adam,</hi> filled up with a higher glory by the <hi>second.</hi> 6. How this blessed light (tho with a <hi>gradual increase,</hi>) did never cease to thine on this world since it began to dawn, not hath there ever ceased a peculiar people in a <hi>Church relation,</hi> who were distinct, and separate from the residue of men, whose profession was founded in the alone faith of a redeemer, so as one day hath not been, since the first <hi>entry</hi> of that promise, wherein, the <hi>sun</hi> did shine on the earth, when the <hi>sun <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:205487:19"/>have had, a higher glory assigned thereto, and a larger extent of the Church; yet would he not restrict the <hi>ingathering of his elect</hi> to any special <hi>periods of time;</hi> or let each age want a share of this glory, and of a seed to be as <hi>salt to the earth.</hi> 7. But this <hi>enquiry</hi> goes further, to see these mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>evidence,</hi> and divine condeshendence, which was given to support the faith of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, on that great promise even by an <hi>ocular</hi> discovery, to the outward sence, as in the whole <hi>frame</hi> and successive course of the <hi>legal sacrifices,</hi> and these numerous <hi>figures,</hi> and <hi>types</hi> in that long preparatory service; wherein he did not let his people feed on asshes, naked shadows, and where nothing was inept or usless, but was expresly significative, of that highest <hi>mystery of Christ,</hi> and could possibly bear no other sence, or intent; and since the whole stress of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith</hi> lyes upon this <hi>one promise,</hi> or what can make the state of man valeuable, in any true enjoiement of his life here, its on this <hi>head</hi> should be sett the first settlement of our faith; for I know nor releef, but in a <hi>promised redeemer,</hi> and if it were not for the <hi>old Testament,</hi> I could not possibly be a <hi>Christian;</hi> if the morning, and growing light, of that glorious mystery, had not gone before its meridian hight, and as a clear conduct to the next step, I shall enter on</p>
            <p>A III. INQUIRY, to know that this <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental promise of a redemers coming to the world
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205487:19"/>is assuredly made good,</hi> and is no more a <hi>matter of faith,</hi> but of <hi>sense,</hi> that its sure our eyes see such a <hi>day,</hi> and long expected <hi>period of time,</hi> and can be no dark or doubtful thing now to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, but may enter on its profession in the open light; but to clear how with the same evidence of the certainty of the promise, we may see its performance also, and if we be sure of the one that it is not possible to be in question about the other, is thus visible. 1. Because we must then part with the <hi>old Testament,</hi> and cease to credit its <hi>divinity,</hi> and no comfort could be from the same; if it had yet failed in this great event, and what is the main intent thereof for if the <hi>promised Messias were yet to come,</hi> I could then look for none, since all these <hi>proper circumstances,</hi> which are so expresly foretold, whereby to know and discern him, must be wholly made void, and ane utter <hi>nullity</hi> should be in that <hi>faith.</hi> 2. Because I could not possibly look for the accomplishment of that <hi>promise,</hi> according to the whole tenor of the <hi>old Testament,</hi> in another way then what we have hereof in the revelation of the Ghospel; yea were it supposable that the <hi>Messias</hi> were yet to come; it is sure I could only look and expect for his acting the same part and in the same appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. 3. Let us but compare the <hi>antient creed</hi> of the Church herein, with that which is ours, now under the dispensation of the <hi>Ghospel,</hi> and see whither they be not entirely on in substance,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:205487:20"/>and center in the same <hi>redeemer,</hi> with this varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, that the one was on the credit and assurance of what was <hi>promised,</hi> and the other or the certainty of its <hi>accomplishment,</hi> so as that may be as applicable, to <hi>Moses, Isaia,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> with other of the Prophets, as to the <hi>Evangelists,</hi> what is spoke by <hi>John Chap.</hi> 20: <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>But these are written that ye might beleeve that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that beleeving you might have life through his name;</hi> where we may see there could be no humane contrivance, in this joint concurring for the same end, and by the same spirit: but yet more specialy lyes the weight of this <hi>enquiry,</hi> to see, 1. how the most solemn times of the <hi>old Testament</hi> was still a <hi>waiting,</hi> and <hi>expecting time,</hi> and that their highest enjoiments, lay in hope of that glory to be revealed in after ages, when the seal should be taken off that great <hi>Prophesy,</hi> then sealed up, and how the whole dispensation of that time was <hi>preparatory,</hi> and as a <hi>prelude</hi> to that great design of grace, which was to be brought forth. 2. How the breaking up of Ghospel, and its first entry on the world, had its <hi>precise time,</hi> and <hi>date,</hi> as that which was so absolutly necessare, for a more clear settling of the Christian Faith, this being a <hi>matter of fact,</hi> and of the highest import that ever was, and was ane <hi>external object of Sense,</hi> in the view of the World, which laid an inevitable constraint, on the whole Christian Church, then to have it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:205487:20"/>keept clear, and under the most exact and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual circumstances. 3, As <hi>Israels</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt in a typical</hi> respect, was a <hi>night,</hi> and <hi>time of such g eat observation,</hi> and that the Lord did put hereon, so special a weight, with respect to the punctual and precise <hi>time</hi> hereof; so was this in a more eminent way, to be matter of highest regard, <hi>when and in what time, the great universal good, and blessing of mankind, our blessed redeemer,</hi> was revealed unto the World, which should begin a <hi>new week,</hi> and that <hi>solemn Epocha,</hi> whence wee reckon the Churches entry on the highest glory of time, and on a <hi>new state.</hi> 4. Hereon hath that solemn observation of the <hi>first day of the week,</hi> as the <hi>Lords day</hi> both its ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, and right; tho it might seem not possible this could ever come under forgetfulness when it was thus fixed, upon the highest certainty, and <hi>precise time,</hi> both of the <hi>sufferings, and resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of the Lord,</hi> in matter of fact; as that <hi>day</hi> and <hi>time</hi> was, which had a <hi>glory</hi> put thereon, that none else could possibly claim, and not time ever since that glas, sett up to their creation, was like unto this, yea which was wholly impossible to fix the Christian Church on the observation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of otherways, but that this was so publick and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the view of the world, and had so great a weight on the primitive Christians, then, when these <hi>morning stars sung together,</hi> and <hi>the Sons of God shouted for joy,</hi> at the first entry of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:205487:21"/>this <hi>new World,</hi> and it may be specially remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, that our Lord did the less inforce the same in an <hi>authoritative way,</hi> both to try and trust the love of his people herein, that what he had done for them, put so strong ane enforement and imposition, to a frequent and solemn remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this blessed day from internal motives; and tho its divine authority be clear, yet the less is of <hi>positive institution</hi> this way, the more strenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning might it be to our <hi>faith,</hi> and more excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also for our <hi>love</hi> herein, were it seriously considered, 5. And of what weight should this <hi>enquiry</hi> be still on mens spirits, that our hope leans novv no more on a <hi>promise,</hi> on which the Saints of old did both live and die, when this makes so essential a change in the Christian Faith, that vvhat ane <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A IV.

As it was surely reserved to the <hi>Ghospel State of the Church,</hi> to be <hi>the Theater of the greatest Wonders both of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Grace,</hi> bejond all that had been known to the World before, and that in the times of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> these great things which should be matter of highest observation, and out of the ordinare road of Gods dealing with his Church then was to be expected, so you can see with full evidence, that this <hi>great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinare appearance of God unto men,</hi> had been never known on the earth before, or any such outgoing of his Power since the beginning of time, which was only reserved to follow the day of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Ascension,</hi> as the first entry of that <hi>glorious Scene,</hi> which was to be acted under the <hi>Ghospel.</hi> 5. And here also this <hi>Reflection</hi> is unavoidable, how the <hi>God of this World</hi> was not easily put off his <hi>visible Throne,</hi> which he had so long kept over the Nations, but the last strugle of these <hi>infernal spirits</hi> ere they were cast down was then very strong, and put forth to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, who yet were made to fall before the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Redeemer</hi> in such a manner, as the whole frame of <hi>Paganism</hi> was then raz'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and their Gods after whom the earth had

            <p n="2">2. But it is yet a further <hi>Inquiry</hi> should be made on this <hi>Head,</hi> to see not only the <hi>outgoings of the Lord Jesus in the Glory of his Power since his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension,</hi> for setting up his <hi>visible Kingdom</hi> in the World, and extent of the Christian Profession, but in the <hi>reality of that vital influence on the souls of men,</hi> with so great and wonderful a change thus made on them from the residue of mankind. This, I doubt not, will be a subject of great thoughts and <hi>reflection</hi> to you, and should be a matter of higher concern to any of a serious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then the temporal interest and transactions, which are about the greatest Kingdoms on the earth. 1. To see how no reality in nature, or the most visible objects of sense, can be more sure, then that under the times of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi> there hath been <hi>innumerable examples of the truth and power of Holiness,</hi> successively from one age to another, in whom it might be no more discernable, that they walked in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of a <hi>humane soull,</hi> then that they did truly walk before men in the <hi>light and power of Christianity,</hi> and under that visible influence of <hi>inward Grace,</hi> as all might see to be above the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:205487:23"/>possibility of <hi>natural causes.</hi> 2. If this were more deeply search'd into, to see what does essentially belong to the <hi>frame and constitution of one reall Christian,</hi> and what a marvelous Power must be put forth herein, it could not but be in another manner affecting, and afford <hi>a Seall to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith,</hi> as does exceed the greatest <hi>external Miracles;</hi> when it's sure one <hi>example</hi> of such, who is truly <hi>converted</hi> by <hi>grace,</hi> and made partaker of the <hi>Divine nature,</hi> is so stupendious a work as does far exceed both the power and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Angels,</hi> yea that the <hi>Glory of the Godhead</hi> does more eminently shine forth in the <hi>first frame,</hi> in the <hi>conduct,</hi> and <hi>perfiting of one Christian,</hi> then either in the <hi>first frame of man</hi> in his state of perfection, or of the <hi>illuminate Angels,</hi> since this is to make <hi>Saints of Sinners,</hi> to turn such from a state of enmity, and inbred opposition to the Holy God to be Lovers of him, and subdue their soulls in that manner, as with inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light can make them part with what was their predominant and endeared Interest, and what hath been as their right hand and eye. This is one of the great discoveries of the <hi>Ghospel.</hi> to let us see how one <hi>converted Christian</hi> is a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> then a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand ordinare Professors</hi> hereof, and may fully silence such a <hi>Question,</hi> why it is, that the <hi>Saints are not more numerous in the World,</hi> comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the great bulk of mankind, yea with these
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:205487:24"/>who go under the Christian Profession, when it might be rather just matter of wonder to see that such <hi>numerous Examples</hi> yet are to be found of this kind in the earth, of whom each, is <hi>one of the greatest of the Works of God,</hi> and infinitely becoming the exceeding greatness of his Power put forth herein; yea are such <hi>Examples,</hi> where the Truth and Excellency of <hi>Grace</hi> does in any eminency shine forth, as may justly supply the Room of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which were given in the <hi>first times</hi> to be confirming to the <hi>Christian Faith;</hi> that these hath assuredly been, and I hope are this day not a few, who doe with desire choise to preferr their <hi>Services for God,</hi> to the greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts &amp; enjoyments of this earth, and are helped not only to keep ground, but gain, under such <hi>conflicts and assaults</hi> in their spiritual course, as go above the <hi>possibility of nature</hi> to withstand. 3. And what a wonder may one Christian be, who does converse with God here on the earth, both to himself and others, who hath such near enjoyments of the <hi>divine presence,</hi> hath such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing hopes, hath ever the <hi>Elect Angels</hi> to be both their guard and observers; and tho the <hi>Saints above</hi> return no more to converse with us, yet is it not questionable, but that they have the same <hi>prospect of the outgoings of providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Saints yet militant,</hi> &amp; as to their <hi>services, trialls, and victories,</hi> which the <hi>Angels</hi> have to whom they are <hi>now made equal,</hi> and in the same
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:205487:24"/>state of perfection; and that they know the <hi>return of their prayers</hi> in behalfe of such who are on the earth, for whom they had wrestled with God whilst they were upon it; yea that the <hi>joy which is in Heaven, and in the presence of the Angels,</hi> on the conversion of sinners respects the whole <hi>Church triumphant;</hi> and I humbly judge even in that sence may the intent of that Scripture be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12: 1. <hi>as to such a cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Let me referr you to one <hi>great instance</hi> also, wherein our <hi>Redeemer</hi> hath in ane eminent way <hi>made himself visible before the World since his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension,</hi> which is in the greatness of that <hi>seall of Martyrdom,</hi> where you may see with joy and admiration that as he did alott the <hi>highest disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of his love unto lost man to the day of the Ghospel,</hi> so did he reserve unto these <hi>times, the highest Testimony and triall of the Love of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to him.</hi> This is a <hi>great Subject,</hi> tho it be easily past without a suitable weight and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the same, how high an interest this hath in the Christian Faith; wherein 1. the truth of such a wonderful <hi>seall in the matter of fact</hi> is not possible to question. 2. And that it's sure there was no personated shew in these unexpressible suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of these Saints for Christ, nor did the World in such a persecuting work, through most of the times of <hi>the New Testament</hi> conflict with a shadow herein; and if a reall <hi>Miracle</hi> be such as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:205487:25"/>exceed the sphere and possibility of nature; it hath thus the most full and undeniable evidence; nor vvere it possible that the <hi>most excellent of the earth</hi> should upon choise act such a part of imbracing death under the greatest torments, when their life and the enjoyments of time was set before them, if they had not been acted by a <hi>Divine Spirit,</hi> and knew these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible comforts and joy, which was then given in for their support, and matter of present sense, and fealing, to be no illusion of mind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. 3 It is on this <hi>Head</hi> you can see and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare what a difference was betwixt the <hi>Legal Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices under the Old Testament,</hi> which were <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative and typical,</hi> and these <hi>freewil offerings</hi> and <hi>oblations of love by Martyrdom</hi> under the Ghospel, which were offered up as a publick <hi>confirmatory Seall to the Divinity of Christ,</hi> and that the <hi>desire of all Nations</hi> was now come; how the one did in a mystery, and under a vaile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Churches Faith of a <hi>Redeemer to come,</hi> the other with the highest evidence of power did attest his being come, and <hi>seall this Testimony with their Blood,</hi> the one from a temporary and <hi>positive Institution,</hi> the other not only under a constraint of light, but an <hi>imposition of love, by the Spirit of Christ, and of Glory resting on them,</hi> was thus offered up, and as to the <hi>quality</hi> of these Sacrifices: how great a difference was herein? the one only of <hi>Beasts,</hi> wherein the Lord would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:205487:25"/>admit no humane Sacrifice to be <hi>typical,</hi> but now after the great <hi>propitiation was offered up,</hi> these <hi>Sacrifices of Love</hi> was not only of <hi>men,</hi> but of the most <hi>excellent of humane race,</hi> who in purity and holiness were the greatest ornament of the earth in their day, the <hi>number</hi> whereof since the Ascension of Christ, is of that extent as can be only known by him who <hi>counts the number of the Stars,</hi> so innumerable have they been; yea as to the <hi>expence</hi> and allowance of so high a service, men can not exerce reason, and not see it did not only answer but exceed the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And is it not matter of sweet <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi> herein, that as the <hi>incomprehensible Love of God</hi> unto man is the <hi>admiration of the elect An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels,</hi> so this illustrious testimony of <hi>humane Love unto God,</hi> is not only made conspicous to them, but is both the foile and torment of the <hi>Powers of Darkness,</hi> to see such a triumph of the Power of Grace amongst <hi>men</hi> here on the earth made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; wherein my soull desires to rejoice that as our <hi>blest Head</hi> hath assigned such a measure of his <hi>sufferings, as a testimony to the truth to be filled up</hi> by his People, under the times of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and to take a higher tryall of the <hi>love of mankind</hi> herein to him, then he would take even of the love of the <hi>blessed Angels,</hi> so hath this <hi>Testimony</hi> with the clearest and undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence been made known.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:205487:26"/>
            <p>But there is a 4. <hi>special Instance</hi> of the out goings of our <hi>Redeemer in a visible discovery of himself to the World since his Ascension,</hi> which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the <hi>successive course of the Ghospel amongst the Nations,</hi> and these remarkable Periods of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and setting of this blessed light on different places of the earth; on which a few things I would speak for your further clearing herein. 1. That it is undeniable, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have their <hi>appointed times,</hi> which must be <hi>fulfilled, Luke</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 24 wherein the <hi>fulness</hi> thereof must be brought in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11:25. which Scriptures bear expresly the same intent, but it's now many ages, since these <hi>times of the Gentiles</hi> hath been fulfilled both in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> where the Ghospel in its course at the <hi>Sun,</hi> hath had its first upbreaking, then in the <hi>East,</hi> and its progress to the <hi>West and Northern Parts of the Earth.</hi> 2. That it is clear, these <hi>times of the Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>fulness</hi> thereof, is to be only understood in <hi>distinct and separate State</hi> from the <hi>Jews,</hi> so that as the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> once had their proper <hi>times</hi> allotted them in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate state from the whole residue of the World, so have the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had their <hi>times under the New Testament,</hi> peculiar to them only; and the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God</hi> hath there expresly shewed, that this great Revolution in the incalling of the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Christian Faith, is not to be expected until these <hi>times</hi> be once accomplish'd, when there shall be then no more distinguishing names of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:205487:26"/>
               <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and no proper interest owned by them in a divided way as formerly, but that the <hi>Lord shall be one, and his name one,</hi> in that blessed frame of his <hi>universal Kingdom;</hi> it's in the faith hereof my soull does rest. 3. How far these <hi>sett times of the Gentiles,</hi> and of the coming in of the <hi>fulness</hi> thereof, be accomplisht, will in due time be disclosed, and with humble so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety we must judge hereof, but it may be so far evident, that then some singular withdrawing of the Spirit of God in the Power of the Ghospel will be discernable from the <hi>Gentile Church,</hi> with the shutting up of these times, and a very low ebb, &amp; great darkness on the whole <hi>Western Churches,</hi> before the rising again of the Glory of that Light, and return of the <hi>Sun</hi> to the <hi>East</hi> again; and how it stands now with the publick State of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Churches</hi> any where, you can more fitly judge and discern.</p>
            <p>There is a V. INQ: yet for a more full settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> that I would seriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly commend, which is on the <hi>whole frame and nature of that pure and excellent Religion we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and the intrinsick perfections thereof;</hi> which beside the <hi>Authority of divine Institution,</hi> you may see <hi>founded in the immutable nature and essence of the same,</hi> and thus have your soull rais'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and rejoice in that <hi>God,</hi> whose <hi>Excellencies</hi> are with that evidence herein display'd, as it is not possible for men to be more blest in the earth,

You must see herewith also, how of <hi>such a nature is this blessed Religion</hi> you enjoy, as can never be <hi>known or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by men until it be enlivened from Heaven,</hi> or be possibly taken up or understood in a <hi>natural way, as humane sciences are,</hi> but must have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>teacher</hi> then men, and a faculty and power <hi>supernatural,</hi> to know and discern the <hi>things of God</hi> herein; yea how in its vvhole <hi>coustitution</hi> it is made up of these great <hi>Excellencies of Light and Life,</hi> which do inseperably meet here; whose <hi>evidence lyes in seeing,</hi> and not in report or a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked testimony to the ear, but is in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the <hi>Sun</hi> is made known by its own beams and light; and it were indeed sad, if the <hi>Sun of Righteousness did not this day shine with as full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to men in this Lower Orb of the Ghospel, as the Meridian Daylight is to our natural sense,</hi> to let us see both the greatness and security of our hope, yea that we are designed for an <hi>Eternal State,</hi> &amp; must therefore seek after a <hi>Blessedness</hi> as will last as long as our <hi>immortal souls</hi> that cannot perish. 3. But this will necessarily carry your thoughts further, to see how the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> does not only with full evidence <hi>manifest it self by its own Light,</hi> but does the more brightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the <hi>opposition of darkness,</hi> and of <hi>every false way and pretence of Religion,</hi> and how the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:205487:28"/>
               <hi>essential Differences betwixt the same</hi> are as fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and visible, as is betwixt the day and night, betwixt truth and falshood, which are founded in the immutable nature of these things themselves; and how <hi>the way of truth</hi> hath surely that <hi>vital air</hi> and <hi>fragrancy</hi> herewith, and such a <hi>native lustre,</hi> as is no more possible for <hi>humane art</hi> and invention to represent, then it were to draw a <hi>living man</hi> on a broad, or for one to draw forth the <hi>natural sent of a Violet or Rose.</hi> 4. It is here also you will find it specially strengthning to see the <hi>nature of these services,</hi> which belong to the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> how here is nothing that is <hi>servile,</hi> or to affright any to come under such a blessed <hi>yoke,</hi> which in its whole <hi>constitution</hi> is so full of a Holy sweetness to allure, and imposeth no <hi>Law of Bondage</hi> on the spirits of men, but what hath inward motives to render it both easy and comforting, does prescribe no duty to be a task, and no service but from love, and where the <hi>Moral Law is purely Evangelick,</hi> and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to us in the <hi>Hands of Mediator,</hi> yea of such a <hi>nature</hi> is the whole obedience and services of the Christian Faith, as you may clearly see that duty on the <hi>matter,</hi> is not anough, where there is not a suitableness thereto in the <hi>manner</hi> of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the same, that the <hi>leading motives and principles</hi> be purely for God; nor can the way of his service be truly followed until his revealed Law have an internal efficacy on mens soull, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205487:28"/>the <hi>Moral Rule of Ghospel Obedience be turned into living and inward principles;</hi> this is a <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> I should commend much to your thoughts, that hath such irresistable evidence therewith for your establishment in the truth, to see, how that blest way, which God hath established to bring man again to himself, is such as no length in any <hi>external part,</hi> or the <hi>outworks</hi> hereof can bear weight, if there be not a <hi>vital influence</hi> on the soull, nor does its interest ever subsist in the World by <hi>humane Power or Authority,</hi> but by an <hi>internal establishment</hi> of the same from its own evidence on the spirits of men. 5. It is here you may see likewise, how the whole <hi>Constitutions of the Christian Faith</hi> are such, as its <hi>highest Glory and Triumph</hi> here on the earth, is still most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicous in the <hi>darkest night of Affliction and Trouble,</hi> and in the most remarkable depths thereof; this is surely a great discovery, and a strange riddle to nature, which stands in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press opposition to the universal sence of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, how this way the Lord does put the highest honor on men here on the earth, in the <hi>passive valour of Christianity,</hi> yea thus puts the most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing marks of respect on his <hi>choisest Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a VI. INQUIRY, I must further direct you to without which no <hi>evidences</hi> of the truth, can be truly effectual on your soull; which is on that <hi>wonderful part of Christianity,</hi> that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:205487:29"/>lyes in the truth of <hi>inward experience, and is the very life and soull of our Religion.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of such a <hi>Subject</hi> makes it more difficult to speak hereon, now in a short <hi>Epistolary Discourse,</hi> but it shall be in as few words as is possible, only to point at such things as may tend to more clear and solid impressions of this <hi>Mystery,</hi> and make way for your own search and tryall of the same; and I hope I may say they are things, which have not been taken on report, or have found it easy to be satisfyed herein, as to a full acquiescence in the truth and assurance thereof; but it's to a few special <hi>ends</hi> I would refer your serious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this <hi>great Inquiry.</hi>

It is here must be understood the first <hi>Acquaintance of men with the Spirit of God;</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:205487:29"/>which is ane <hi>acquaintance</hi> of that concern, as the Lord hath laid over the weight of his peoples spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual joy, refreshment, and support, whilst they are within time, on the same; and is the first <hi>entry</hi> on <hi>converse with spirits,</hi> and with <hi>God, the Father of spirits</hi> which shall be <hi>eternal.</hi> 3. It is such, as hath a distinct <hi>evidence</hi> from any <hi>moral influence</hi> by the Word or <hi>light</hi> to the judgment; and is the proper object of spiritual sense, which no <hi>humane power,</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But whatever singular use is hereby to the support of our Faith, yet are they not the grounds thereof; since these are only, what God hath <hi>spoke in his word,</hi> and not what he hath <hi>done in his work;</hi> tho they are at a great loss who have begun late to observe the same: it is true the greatest <hi>talent,</hi> which is by <hi>inward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,</hi> and <hi>experiments</hi> which have been most deeply affecting in the present time; does not abide in the same <hi>sense,</hi> and <hi>fealing,</hi> and may ly as a <hi>dead stock</hi> upon a Christians hand, without fresh, and immediate supplies; yet are they still the same in the truth thereof, and does ever evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, how far the enjoiment of grace, and of a spiritual estate does exceed the greatest enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature. 8. This also must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not only by the testimony of inward sense, but what comes under the most <hi>exact,</hi> and <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tryall,</hi> as to the principles it leans on, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, there could be no true enjoiment of the same, if they were not as fully satisfied of holding their <hi>experience by right, as in possession,</hi> and that these great things are no shadowes or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:205487:30"/>but what is of the highest <hi>truth, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> and <hi>reality.</hi> 9. It is sure that God is not known in the earth, or enjoyed in <hi>truth,</hi> but in the <hi>light of inward evidence</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in such a manner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

It is by inward <hi>experience</hi> upon the souls of men, that God doeth in a more special way <hi>secure,</hi> and preserve, that <hi>sacred record of his truth</hi> in the World, then by <hi>humane Lawes,</hi> or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; by ane <hi>internal</hi> conforming of the spirits of his people, to his revealed truth, whereby the inward man becomes as a <hi>repository</hi> thereof, for when men once become Christians in truth, they are then the <hi>declared Epistle of Christ</hi> by ane indissoluble union of the truth, and their souls together. I shall but add, that the <hi>experimental part of Religion</hi> is not perfited here, but within a little, there will be ane entrance on ane eternity of <hi>experience</hi> of what once with admiration, and desire, was hoped for, and the enjoiment of that state above will be no <hi>object of Faith,</hi> but of <hi>sense</hi> and purely <hi>experimental.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>This Inquiry</hi> should be of special use like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to know <hi>what great things these are, to which, the experimental part of Christianity does relate,</hi> wherein they of the <hi>lowest sise of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians have a common, and joint interest</hi> whatever difference be in the <hi>degree;</hi> but it is a very <hi>short touch</hi> I can here give on so great a subject and on some few <hi>Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>translation, and entry of a Christian
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:205487:32"/>unto a new state, and world, here in the earth;</hi> is one of the greatest things of <hi>experience</hi> (tho it hath not a like clear evidence, nor the precise time, and <hi>entry</hi> can be in the same manner known) for men to know so marvelous a <hi>chan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> in themselves, and that here is no <hi>illusion</hi> or <hi>dream,</hi> and how it is sure this was never told to mankind but in the <hi>Bible,</hi> which none ever did foresee, or project to themself; yea which in the very <hi>notion</hi> thereof, was once a <hi>terra incognita</hi> to them; and could have no possible rise from <hi>nature</hi> whose proper work is to <hi>overcome nature.</hi> I know this may seeme astonishing, and not easie for many to bear, that professed Christians may have the same need to be converted to Christianity that <hi>Pagans</hi> have, or perish, that the letter of the word only, or any length in external duties can save none, who know nothing of internal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or the spiritual Powers of Christianity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It does relate to this <hi>Head,</hi> to know that <hi>God and his People here in the World, are no stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to other in the truth, and enjoiment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him,</hi> for as this is ane <hi>essential part of our Faith,</hi> and one of the most sure, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished <hi>constitutions of our Religion,</hi> by ane <hi>unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable rule,</hi> so is it matter of undoubted enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without which a Christians <hi>course,</hi> and <hi>passage</hi> through time were <hi>unpassible;</hi> it is true this is so great a thing as may make the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Christian to <hi>be a wonder to himself,</hi> and is not a <hi>subject</hi> of ordinary thoughts.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:205487:32"/>
            <p n="3">3. To this belongs also the <hi>truth;</hi> and <hi>enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of supernatural comforts here on the earth</hi> such as <hi>peace immediatly from God, and the joys of the Holy Ghost,</hi> which can have no possible rise from nature, and was never known to men, but on this <hi>tryall of experience,</hi> that such a thing is sure, with respect unto which the <hi>highest experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature</hi> are low, and of mean concern; yea which are comforts of that kind, as can be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known by its contrary, and hath been still more ouweing to the <hi>sorest conflicts,</hi> then to the <hi>sweetest calm</hi> of a <hi>Christians life,</hi> and such as the elect Angels did never know or partake of.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>prevalency of prayer with God,</hi> and to know with assured evidence both the <hi>acceptance hereof in Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>returns thereof upon the earth,</hi> is also one of these great things of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,</hi> and can never be known else as a subject of contemplation only, which hath been direct of the Lord as a prescript for such ones where no humane wisdome or power could possibly answer, and is not bounded by the most desperate case, which would seem to shut out all hope and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radgment▪ But as to this I must say how little seemes that part of our Religion, tho one of the most wonderful parts thereof to be improven in that manner now as in former times, and in the most extraordinare exigences which Christians have been in, yea how low a trade is it which by most this day is carried on, in so marvelous a way
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:205487:33"/>as this, which the Lord hath established betwixt <hi>heaven and earth,</hi> and hath such immediate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with the whole <hi>inward life, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls of Christianity,</hi> to preserve and strenthen the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> 5. <hi>Head</hi> on this Subject to be matter of great thoughts and <hi>reflection</hi> is this, that here on the earth there is such a thing to be enjoyed in the truth and certainty of <hi>experience,</hi> as an <hi>earnest and seall of the Spirit of God</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth</hi> 1:22. <hi>who hath also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts Ephes.</hi> 1:13. <hi>in whom also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ye beleeved, ye were sealed by that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5:5. <hi>now he that hath wrought us for the self same thing is God, who hath also given us the earnest of his Spirit.</hi> I know there hath been much inquiry on this <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> as to a clear <hi>sence,</hi> and judgment thereof, both by <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and <hi>Practical Writers,</hi> tho it is such a thing as must needs be a strange, and dark riddle where the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is not the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter;</hi> and some near entercourse with this great <hi>teacher,</hi> that in his <hi>light we may see light;</hi> but that it is surely promised of God, and could never have entred on mens thoughts, if it were not purely a divine Revelation, none will offer to question; and that the experience of the same in all times of the Church, hath no less tendency to confirm and seall the truth of Christianity,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:205487:33"/>then it hath to confirm a Christians state; but though I doubt not your acquaintance herewith is bejond many, yet this beeing a truth of such high concern, so far as I have attained, I would offer some light hereon, wherein my soul hath found <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>settlement,</hi> as to a clear sence and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same. 1. That how rare soever the <hi>experience</hi> of this may be this day, yet is it not the peculiar priviledge of some <hi>few, select,</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Christians,</hi> or what God does rarely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and on some singular account to his people, but is the settled priviledge of all who are <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> and under his conduct. 2. This is ane <hi>experiment of the Christian Faith,</hi> which no humane testimony or <hi>vocal evidence</hi> can express, that which is <hi>inward,</hi> and a secret betwixt God and the soul, or what <hi>taste that hidden Manna hath Rev.</hi> 2:17. <hi>which none knowes but he that enjoys the same;</hi> for this is not the <hi>promise,</hi> which is given to be the <hi>object of our Faith,</hi> but is the <hi>seall of the Spirit of promise,</hi> and the <hi>proper object of spiritual sense;</hi> it is an internal work which goes above words, and such as God alone can impart, who only can reveal his own love to the soul, and <hi>Shed abroad the sence hereof,</hi> and hath reserved this to himself; it is that also which gives a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct evidence from any moral influence of the word, tho it can never be disjoined, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the same, but is such ane internal appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hereof, as puts their souls to rest and quiet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:205487:34"/>thereon. 3. It is here must be understood a more <hi>near</hi> and <hi>solemn approach of God,</hi> and some <hi>highes enjoiment of Spiritual Sense,</hi> then is usually know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which will make such a time remarkable, and sweet to a Christians after remembrance, the some in, a more extraordinar way, and higher degree, may have this imparted then others, as the tryall of their Faith hath been more heightned and hath attained to higher actings of grace unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the same, according to that settled <hi>Conneclin Isay</hi> 57:12. I doubt not, there may be high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to this <hi>Seall and earnest,</hi> who know little what in the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>order of grace</hi> is required to prepare, and qualifie for the same, but except the <hi>setled constitutions</hi> of the Ghospel, should be changed for their sake; it is then sure that God did never <hi>seall the comforts of his Spirit,</hi> or his respects and approving testimony on such, who are of ane untender, unhumbled, and vindictive spirit, and is no more possible, then as <hi>Job</hi> 18:4. <hi>That the earth should be forsaken for them, and the rock removed out of its place.</hi> 4. It is true this is more clearly understood by such, who by <hi>reason of use, have their senses exercised both to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern good, and evill Hebrews</hi> 5:14. and have thus attained a more deep, and judicious refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for the tryall of the same, since this is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually one of the most searching exercises of a Christian, to discern the <hi>voice of the Spirit of God,</hi> and know the same, from that of a <hi>Stranger,</hi> and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:205487:34"/>to come to the light herein, to see that such a <hi>seall,</hi> or any rare enjoiments of that kind, are assuredly from God, and wrought in him <hi>John</hi> 3:21. It is clear also how, many <hi>sharp conflicts,</hi> and <hi>a hotter ware fare</hi> allotted to some of the Saints, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, under griefs, troubles, and oppositions in their Christian course, hath made way at so dear a rate for their acquaintance with the same, so as the gradual difference, in the truth of this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, may be strange, and marvelous, and cause fear to impart the same, nor be ever known within time. 5. Tho it is sure, that all who are entred in a <hi>reconciled state with God,</hi> must be <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Spirit,</hi> yet is not this to be understood as the ordinar <hi>food,</hi> and <hi>dyet of a Christian,</hi> but as some more special <hi>restorative,</hi> and <hi>cordial,</hi> so as one enjoiment of this kind, hath been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so remarkable, that through the whole course of a Christians life after, it hath been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued strenthning to their Faith; yet is it no rare thing to these who are keeped in a more near in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy of converse with God, to whom, the truth of this <hi>seall</hi> not once, but in innumerable times, hath been known, who, on the other hand does know also, how long, and sensible restraint of this great enjoiment may be, when the choisest promises of the Word, can afford no comfort, but when the <hi>premises are clear,</hi> the <hi>conclusion is oft suspended</hi> through <hi>hid jealousies,</hi> and <hi>legall fears of the spirit of bondage.</hi> 6. It is sure this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:205487:35"/>
               <hi>blessed seall</hi> lyes here also, in some special <hi>directive work of the Spirit of God,</hi> to make use of <hi>light,</hi> in <hi>particular cases</hi> with <hi>assurance,</hi> and <hi>quiet of mind,</hi> and in <hi>sealing instruction</hi> with that evidence, and power on the soull, as leaves such a <hi>print</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> thereon as the <hi>seall</hi> leaves on the <hi>wax,</hi> this can be no strange, or unknown thing to these who in a close adherence, to Scripture light hath been specially tender to try the same thereby, and under a just horror, and dread of <hi>Enthusiasm:</hi> or the smallest dasshing on such a <hi>rock.</hi> 7. But it is specially discernable, where this <hi>seall</hi> and <hi>earnest</hi> hath been more abundantly let forth to some bejond others; that it was for some higher support to their Faith, where a <hi>long interval of delay</hi> was to be between the <hi>promise,</hi> and <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and such a tryall of a <hi>deferred hope</hi> herein, us might be ready to make <hi>their heart sick</hi> into death, if the Lord had not given such a <hi>pledge</hi> and <hi>part in hand</hi> to assure them that the rest shall not faill in due time, now this is so manifest in the <hi>conduct,</hi> and <hi>methods</hi> of grace, about the Saints under the <hi>old Testament,</hi> and in how singular a <hi>way</hi> he did first <hi>seall,</hi> before he entred them upon any <hi>great tryalls,</hi> and which were to be of a <hi>long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> as there needs no particular <hi>instances</hi> to clear the same. 8. It is here, the sence of that <hi>hundred fold,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath so expresly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to his People on the adventures of their Faith may be understood, as that which assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:205487:35"/>lyes in these rare enjoiments of the spirit, and <hi>inward sense of the love of their God,</hi> in the shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his face on them, which are the <hi>first fruits of the Spirit;</hi> more then in any external provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or these things which are of the highest value with men; since as this is the most sure and greatest evidence that we are Christians, so is it the most notable <hi>sign</hi> how dear such are to God, and of his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> then if he had given them the whole World. I know nothing will seem more strange, and disrelishing to the spirit of most this day then such a thing, but <hi>wisdom is justified of her Children,</hi> and with such let my <hi>soul</hi> be joined in. 9. As it is known and sure that here is no <hi>illusion</hi> or <hi>imaginary thing,</hi> where any <hi>fallacy</hi> or <hi>deceit</hi> lyes, to the most judicious and observing Christians, who knows herein, what makes them glad, and whence it is, and how no assistance of their own spirit, or in the power of nature could possibly impart such a thing; so may it be astonishing how such who live under the Profession of Christ, and hath any design on ane eternal state in Heaven, can take this on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or be so little inquisitive about so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a truth, that there should be such ane enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here on the earth, which without any <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cause,</hi> can put the soul of men into ane <hi>entire rest, and settlement,</hi> and when under greatest <hi>thakings</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> other ways, cause them know the truth of <hi>pardon,</hi> and <hi>peace with God</hi> with a sure
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:205487:36"/>evidence, yea at so low ane ebb can immediatly revive and raise with so discernable a change in their inward case; for if this be ane undoubted matter of experience it should be not easie for men to live without tryall hereof themselves. 10. Let me <hi>add</hi> further, here is a part of that <hi>communion</hi> which Christians have within time, with the most <hi>excellent of the earth;</hi> and such who in all <hi>ages of the Church</hi> have been the greatest lovers of God, and adventurers for him; such with whom he hath been most familiar, and hath admit not only to the <hi>allowance of Subjects,</hi> but the <hi>regard of favourites,</hi> who hath known how great a <hi>Rewards</hi> he is of his own <hi>grace,</hi> yea such, who have made the most exact <hi>inquiry</hi> and <hi>tryall,</hi> upon the truth and security of their comfort here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and <hi>hath put to their seall that God is faithfull and true, in that he hath thus promised.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There is this <hi>special use</hi> to be made of such ane <hi>enquiry on the truth of inward experience, to see how great, and wonderful a Subject we have for reflection hereon;</hi> and of what singular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage this should be for strenthning the soul of a Christian, against the workings of <hi>unbeleef,</hi> and to give a more full security of mind in the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of hope and relyance upon God, for things to come.

To have such great supernatural truths of the Scripture, which did once exceed their faith, and reason, to be now matter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>experience</hi> in the truth, power, and efficacy hereof on their own souls; and thus to know what belongs to the enjoiments of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sence, which formerly seemed so darke and incomprehensible a thing, yea how great a <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> there is betwixt the <hi>clearest Acts of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>understanding</hi> about <hi>divine things;</hi> and a reall <hi>fealing</hi> of the same in the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> thereof; betwixt the most sublime apprehensions by <hi>theory;</hi> and the <hi>sensible impressions,</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and what a present, and marvelous change this makes on the soull of a Christian. 2.

To see, how these great things of <hi>experience,</hi> come under a <hi>present tryall,</hi> and given to be experienced here on the <hi>earth,</hi> and are not some <hi>rare contingency,</hi> or what may be stated on an <hi>extraordinar</hi> account, but does keep closs with a <hi>tender walk,</hi> and near enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours with God through a Christians whole course; and thus knows what such an <hi>anointing with fresh oyl</hi> means <hi>Psalm</hi> 92:10. by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reiterated times of such enjoiment; yea how the sense and sweetness thereof comes not then by the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>workings of reason;</hi> but the <hi>immediatness of the divine presence,</hi> tho even then it does not exclude such a <hi>discursive work,</hi> in the clearness of <hi>Spiritual reason,</hi> and <hi>light,</hi> as can fully quiet the mind, that here is no <hi>illusion,</hi> or <hi>deceit;</hi> but lets us see, that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> can make use of an <hi>argument</hi> to settle, and secure the soul when all essays, whither from themselves, or others can give no releaf. 6. Thus are they admitt to see herewith, how deep the foundation of our <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>security,</hi> is layd on <hi>the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of God</hi> in <hi>his</hi> revealed truth, so as the whole <hi>frame of Christianity</hi> must be dissolved, and fall ere one special act of trust, and adventure on his hand, and under the assured warrant of his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:205487:38"/>truth, should be frustrate; and that the <hi>safe conduct</hi> also, and <hi>security of one Christian,</hi> in his passage through time, is of that <hi>consequence,</hi> and so <hi>essential a part of the great frame of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> that this should not be entire, and perfect if it should fail, as to the meanest of the Saints, to make so great a <hi>nullity</hi> herein. 7. And is it not, in such a <hi>reflex work</hi> on the truth of <hi>experience,</hi> that such can only know the <hi>sweet enjoiments of times past,</hi> and what that peculiar comfort <hi>of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> means; which I must reckon one of the rarest, and most unknown enjoiments this day under the Sun; since it is sure, this can never be from the <hi>greatest delights of the earth,</hi> when once passed, which as they return no more, so does ever leav a bitter <hi>sting,</hi> and <hi>remembrance,</hi> by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive result of the same; whilst that which hath been experienced in the way of God, can neither <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi> nor lose its <hi>sweetness,</hi> but will render the most <hi>afflicting part of their life past,</hi> which was most bitter, and fore then, to be the most <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting part</hi> thereof to their remembrance, when they can see herein both what they have <hi>designe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If there be any comfort <hi>of love, in the Communion of the Saints here</hi> within time, they may see how this is not attainable, but in the <hi>light of inward expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> whence they know, what it is to meet, and have fellowship in the same <hi>Savour,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of the things of God,</hi> when in a spiritual frame,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:205487:38"/>and to be <hi>mutually disclosed</hi> as they can discern something of the excellency of one <hi>anothers spirit,</hi> and of the power, and lively workings of <hi>inward grace,</hi> by that <hi>native lustre, and evidence,</hi> which thus followes the same; so as under the sensible power of such <hi>attractions</hi> their souls are more clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely unite, and joined together, yea are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally strenthned by other conflicts, and what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments they have made of divine truth herein as to their releaf. And I must say where this is not understood, that great <hi>mystery of the Communion of the Saints,</hi> is but a <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>dark notion;</hi> nor without this can that special design of the Lord in the <hi>settlement of Churches in a visible state,</hi> be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known or answered, which is to have exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ordinances carried on with life, and power amongst men, and enjoying communion with our <hi>blessed head</hi> herein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> VII. <hi>and last</hi> INQUIRY. I would make as to a more full assurance of understanding on the truth of our profession, and for further clearing of this <hi>great Subject</hi> of the <hi>experimental part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> is to know the <hi>quality of the witnesses there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> which is an <hi>Inquiry</hi> of a higher concern and import then seems to be apprehended, or of what weight, and necessity this is, upon these <hi>grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the whole truth of <hi>Spiritual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> is matter of <hi>fact,</hi> and founded on a <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of sense,</hi> it is <hi>truth in the event and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:205487:39"/>and not what <hi>God does speak,</hi> but what <hi>according to the same he hath done;</hi> so that this is not upon any <hi>principle of Faith,</hi> but on mens <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal tryall of the same,</hi> according to that <hi>Isai.</hi> 43: <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>ye are my witness says the Lord, that ye may know, and beleeve me, and understand that I am he;</hi> for tho it is of divine, and infallible truth, that whatever God hath <hi>assured by promise</hi> he will do; yet the experience hereof, since the <hi>Canon of the Scripture was sealed,</hi> is of humane record, and a <hi>testimony</hi> which could bear no weight from the greatest of men, if the <hi>quality of such witnesses</hi> were not <hi>tried,</hi> and considered herein. 2. Because the highest pretence to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enjoiments in the way of the <hi>promise</hi> is but a false testimony, where there is no tender regard herewith to the <hi>precepts of the Ghospel,</hi> when this connection is indissoluble <hi>Act</hi> 9. <hi>they walked in the fear of God, and comforts of the Holy Ghost; doe not my words good to them that walk uprightly Mica</hi> 2:7. It is true, that choisest Christians may be much hid, and in the dark herein to others, and upon such an account should have a sad part, if they were tryed, and judged by men; only this is sure, there can be no more in the <hi>conclusion</hi> then is in the <hi>premises,</hi> and that a Christians <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> to the truth lyes more in <hi>what they are,</hi> then <hi>what they express to others.</hi> 3. The <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>witnesses</hi> is of such weight here, and to be specially regarded, as one of the <hi>highest services
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:205487:39"/>for God within time</hi> under their hand, to <hi>put too their seall,</hi> and <hi>testimony that God is true in what he hath promised;</hi> who are as it were <hi>judicially sisted</hi> in behalf of his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulnes;</hi> since his <hi>declarative glory before angels,</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> does more peculiarly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Inquiry</hi> is the more called for, to know what these are who bear such a <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> to the truth, upon the <hi>exceeding greatnes of these things</hi> which belong to Christian <hi>experience,</hi> since this might awake the most sublin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:205487:40"/>can ever amount to, or is upon the Sun, and the Stars of Heaven. 5. The <hi>credit, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Witnesses</hi> on this <hi>great head of Spiritual experience,</hi> and the whole <hi>internal part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> is of such weight that the spirit of this age, and most predominant part of men within the Church is stated in so visible an opposition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, not only to oppose the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>spirituality</hi> of Religion, but to deny its <hi>principles,</hi> and give a lye to this testimony, of the most eminent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of the spirit of God on mens souls, as if it were some <hi>illusion</hi> or <hi>imposture;</hi> which is in effect to take of the <hi>greatest seall</hi> that God hath given to the <hi>Divinity of the Scripture</hi> in the whole <hi>internal demonstrations</hi> of its truth: this is the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy of this age bejond any times past, and may be feared if our Faith stood not sure otherways, that the light should be quickly extinguished, and the candlestick taken away from most of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches; when most, under such a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion yet never knew, the <hi>power, vertue,</hi> and <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the truth</hi> they profess on their own soul, and that there is another evidence or teaching, then by <hi>moral swasion</hi> only, or another key to open the heart, then <hi>external means;</hi> and thus must either oppose themselves to so tormenting a light, or be unavoidably condemned hereby.</p>
            <p>But with this <hi>Inquiry</hi> as to the credit and <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the witnesses,</hi> who in all ages of the Church bears the same testimony to the truth from their
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:205487:40"/>
               <hi>experience,</hi> it is undenyable also, but that there are some in a <hi>more singular way sisted, and under more peculiar engagements then others</hi> to appear on such a <hi>testimony,</hi> and who may be admit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiments of <hi>experience,</hi> that are out of the <hi>ordinary road</hi> of Gods dealing with his people, tho this must in no other sense be understood <hi>exiraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> then from so <hi>judicial a time</hi> as this, and the great <hi>decay of the Power of Christianity</hi> with this generation why these are so rare, and not in beeing any way cross to the <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>settled constitutions of the Ghospel,</hi> or without that <hi>precinct of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God to warrand the same;</hi> and I hope the Church of Christ is yet to enter on such enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of experience that would not be easie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in this day we are in, were they told us at a distance. But what I mean hereby of these, who may be in a higher capacity then others for such a <hi>witness</hi> I shall breefly touch.</p>
            <p n="1">1. These who through grace hath been admit to <hi>some higher intimacy of converse with God, and to know his dealing familiarly with men here on the earth,</hi> then may be ever known in such a degree to other choise, and reall Christians; tho I judge this may be more rarely known, that where it is most in truth, there also is a humble conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and beeing hid in the same, their usual studie, who finds more sweetness in such enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the less air they take; &amp; I have oft thought such may be least known on the earth in this day
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:205487:41"/>who may be the greatest <hi>favourits of Heaven,</hi> and have had most rare, and immediate <hi>testimonies</hi> of the love, and respects of their God; but as this it not the <hi>standard</hi> by which the truth, and reality of grace is to be judged; so should this <hi>witness</hi> be to me no further strenthning, then it hath some greater height in <hi>humility,</hi> and <hi>tenderness of Spirit</hi> in the ways of God going alongst herewith, and some more singular eminency of grace as does an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that <hi>Isai</hi> 57: 15. <hi>John</hi> 14: 21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I must judge these also have <hi>a higher room</hi> in this <hi>witness for God on their experience of his truth,</hi> who have in a <hi>more singular way then others known the truth of supernatural assistance, and sustaining grace under extraordinar tryalls.</hi> I mean such Christians as have been tryed not only in the <hi>truth,</hi> but in the <hi>strenth of divine grace,</hi> at another rate then others, whom I must reckon amongst the greatest <hi>witnesses</hi> for God in this day, when 1. This renders their <hi>testimony</hi> to be of a higher valew and evidence according to the height, and measure of their <hi>conflicts,</hi> and <hi>tryalls,</hi> whom thus the Lord hath choised, and separate as <hi>Joseph</hi> was from the <hi>residue of his brethren,</hi> for such a service of <hi>example,</hi> that the excellency of his grace might here more brightly shine forth. 2. Because the <hi>deposition</hi> herein, is in a matter on which most doe stumble at the ways of God, upon that scandall of the cross; and on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it may be said, they are sent as <hi>messengers,</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:205487:41"/>and <hi>spyes,</hi> to witness what manner of allowance he does then impart, to bear the expence of a more extraordinare time of affliction, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and what immediate support is then found above the allowance of ordinary times; that with <hi>Caleb,</hi> and <hi>Joshua,</hi> they might bear a honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable report for God unto others. 3. The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of this <hi>testimony</hi> riseth the higher, as it hath cost them so dear, who bear the same, and hath not been easily attained, nor is an <hi>offering unto God of that which costs them nothing,</hi> who have been helped bejond others to glorify him in the <hi>fires.</hi> 4. They are such above the residue of Christians, who hath usually a <hi>record of more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial confirmations,</hi> and great remarks of the way of God, in the <hi>Journal,</hi> and <hi>History of their life;</hi> I know most would fear to have a room in such a testimony, but as I doubt not there are many such <hi>witnesses</hi> this day in the earth, so I must reckon it, one of the most honourable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for God upon it, and will ere long know the full sence of that truth; when <hi>he hath tryed them to bring them forth as gold Job</hi> 23: 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And are not such specially sisted as <hi>witnesses</hi> herein, and under more <hi>singular engagements then others,</hi> who upon greater <hi>Services</hi> for God assigned to them, hath also had more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare allowances, of immediate <hi>divine assistance</hi> for the same, to witness that they have not been sent hereon on their own <hi>charge,</hi> and <hi>expence;</hi>

            <p n="5">5. There is yet something more <hi>singular</hi> in the <hi>experience</hi> of some Christians bejond others, and in such a <hi>witness,</hi> as to a <hi>special confidence,</hi> and <hi>assurance raised on their soul, of events of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and the <hi>issue of some remarkable case of tryall, when it hath been contrare to all humane appearances, and no reason from any visible airth could be given for the same;</hi> this I know may seem a strange thing in the eyes of many, nor can it possibly have that <hi>evidence,</hi> or in that manner work to others, as it is to these, who know, and have experienced the same, but we see, and are sure there hath been great attainments of such a Faith, both in <hi>Scripture examples,</hi> and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted <hi>experiments,</hi> made hereof in after times, which hath met such in the road of their duty, and in ane express harmony, and correspondence with the Word, since the <hi>extent of our Faith in any particular case,</hi> must keep with the same <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and measure of divine Revelation</hi> herein, and the Lord will be <hi>trusted for no more then he hath made warrantable by his promise.</hi> But this is a <hi>Subject,</hi> on which I may not insist further then to clear the <hi>evidence</hi> and truth of the sameon these grounds. 1. That Christians may be at such <hi>steps</hi> in their way and passage through time, and on so dark ground; yea the <hi>tide</hi> of <hi>difficulties,</hi> and <hi>amasing fears</hi> swelled to so great a hight, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:205487:43"/>if there were not a support of this kind, by ane <hi>argument of power,</hi> to their soul, they should otherways be ready to sink. 2. This <hi>experiment</hi> how rare so ever it may seem to many, is no <hi>dark,</hi> or <hi>distinct thing</hi> from that <hi>seall of the spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> which we should look after; or from that <hi>promised earnest,</hi> which sometimes the Lord gives, with respect to a <hi>special mercy,</hi> and <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> within time as well as their <hi>great interest in Heaven,</hi> tho it be not in the same <hi>degree</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to some as to others. 3. It is also of no other kind then that settled allowance on the <hi>Saints,</hi> of the <hi>peace of God</hi> in such a measure as can raise, and fully quiet their spirit, above any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fears, and above the <hi>present assault</hi> they may be under, tho with such evidence then, as is not possible to attain at other times, nor can be kept clear, and comforting to themselves without much <hi>tendernesse of spirit and fear.</hi> 4. Where this is known, and enjoyed in any higher degree by some then may be the allowance of others, it is assuredly found on a special &amp; near intimacy with God, and to follow some discernable access, and special <hi>gale of the spirit of intercession in prayer, and wrestlings;</hi> so as it thus meets them in the way of a settled <hi>ordinance,</hi> and in the same way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we may see the Saints in Scripture have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a confidence of this kind; for otherways there could be no comforting evidence of its beeing the undoubted <hi>work of God.</hi> 5. And here
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:205487:44"/>must be tryed, &amp; sought for, whither the more <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate testimony of God,</hi> does then still bring the <hi>testimony</hi> of the <hi>renewed conscience</hi> alongst there with so as to clear the condition in themselves, and their claim thereto, of such a special promise, whereon their confidence hath been raised, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is thus rendred to them an <hi>absolute promise;</hi> that can not possibly be frustrate. 6. I shall but add further as this <hi>rare experiment</hi> comes with such <hi>evidence of spiritual sense,</hi> as is discernable from any <hi>natural workings</hi> of mans own heart, and is that wherein the most deep enquiry and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious tryall of Christians is needful to know that its surely from God, and hath both his <hi>warrant,</hi> and <hi>seall</hi> herewith, so is it not strange that where he takes a more <hi>singular way</hi> to <hi>try</hi> and exercise some, and out of the ordinar road of his dealing with others, yea where support in the way of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal providence</hi> may then cease, that this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial allowance by <hi>inward evidence</hi> be something more singular also, and some <hi>higher influence of the spirit and power of beleeving</hi> be imparted for such a <hi>case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This leads me to offer some thoughts in the <hi>close</hi> upon two <hi>Proposals,</hi> which I did not intend, if from another <hi>airth,</hi> whilst I was writing this there had not occurred a <hi>special call</hi> herein, and that I judged it might not be unsuitable to the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Whither there be any such <hi>seall</hi> to the <hi>truth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:205487:44"/>of Christianity</hi> in these times we are now in as the <hi>Faith of Miracles, or that it be warrantable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect such a thing from God, which lyes in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act of trust in some special case, where a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may be taken off all ordinare means, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a divine immediate, and miraculous Power can answer thereto;</hi> for <hi>Answer</hi> it is clear the <hi>active Faith</hi> hereof which was once given to <hi>the Primitive Church</hi> in the <hi>workings of miracles</hi> now ceaseth, but in this <hi>passive Sence,</hi> I know no <hi>time,</hi> nor <hi>age,</hi> to which it does not belong, and comes not under the <hi>Promise of God,</hi> to warrant the same in these cases.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the Lord measures out <hi>such tryalls</hi> to any of his people in the way of their duty, and under his special conduct, where there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf, or support, but in the <hi>Faith of ane extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinar, and immediate appearance of God,</hi> and no neglect in the least; of what in the way of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinare,</hi> and <hi>warrantable</hi> means is attainable, it is sure, there it is both warranted and requires such <hi>a Faith,</hi> yea are put by a more singular call on the tryall of the same, and in this respect; I doubt not there hath been, and may yet be in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age greater attainments of the same,</hi> then most of Christians can easily comprehend, whose tryalls were never brought to such a pitch, and in that manner assigned to them; since these are of the Lord measured out only according to the <hi>measure of Faith</hi> given them <hi>Rom.</hi> 12: 3.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:205487:45"/>
            <p n="2">2.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is unquestionable that the Lord designs in all <hi>ages of his Church,</hi> to bring glory to himself, by such a <hi>faith as hath no ground to grip on,</hi> but <hi>ane infinit and immediate power</hi> that can extend it self to the most desperate and amasing case, nor is a <hi>beleeving in hope, when it is to be furthest against hope,</hi> a strange and dark thing in this day, either as to the warrant hereof, or these proofs, which have been made of the same in the issue. And herein I must judge the appearance of God no less wonderful to some of his people in that which he <hi>works in them,</hi> and in that deliverance from their <hi>fears</hi> where no <hi>humane Reason or Secondary causes</hi> could concurr, then in that which he hath <hi>done for them</hi> in the most <hi>stupendious acts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> nor does any time want some share and proper <hi>talent</hi> of this kinde, if such <hi>great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of God</hi> were more observed, that

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Is there a reall Christian this day, who is not called to such a <hi>Faith,</hi> that he shall once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself <hi>experience</hi> a greater <hi>miracle</hi> by a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine omnipotent Power</hi> then was yet ever wrought in the earth, which is of the <hi>Resurrection of his body,</hi> after it hath been for some ages dissolved into dust, wherein it is, by the undoubted <hi>Faith of miracles</hi> to be wrought upon himself, that his greatest <hi>support</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> within time stands; yea if there be such a Faith in the earth, which is now still warranted, as that we have <hi>Ps.</hi> 46: 12. it must then ly in ane <hi>actual trust,</hi> and <hi>relyance in a case where a miracle can only help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If <hi>possessions by the Devil</hi> were in that manner now usual as in the <hi>primitive times,</hi> it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, that the <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> herein for <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possession</hi> were not only warranted, but expresly called for, tho the <hi>inward assurance</hi> of such a <hi>Faith</hi> may not in the same manner be given to some as to others; yet here is a special suiting from God the <hi>proof of a miracle,</hi> by <hi>his immediate Power,</hi> which they are in faith called too; and as that <hi>Prescript</hi> given by our <hi>Lord of fasting and prayer</hi> for this end does still stand in force so hath there been known publick instances in these <hi>late times, of reall dispossessions by prayer,</hi> and solemn addresses to Heaven herein.</p>

To know its <hi>true rise</hi> and <hi>original,</hi> which I find in the <hi>English Chronicles</hi> to be <hi>dated from the time of Edward the Confessor,</hi> when <hi>Antichristian darkness</hi> was then at his greatest height, it beeing in the 1042 <hi>Year,</hi> when he began to reign, and when that <hi>Prediction of the Apostle Thessal</hi> 2: 2. of a more then ordinary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and <hi>working of Satan, with signs and lying wonders</hi> to promote the <hi>Antichristian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, was then taking place; and was in that sence only admitt to confirm the <hi>Romish Faith</hi> by such a strange miracle. 2. This <hi>Inquiry</hi> should be necessar herein, whither this pretended mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous power belong to the <hi>Crown</hi> only, or hath respect to the <hi>Quality, and Holiness of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> who weare the same, since if it be to the <hi>first,</hi> then tho ane <hi>Infidel,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetan</hi> were esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished on the Throne, if this <hi>gift</hi> follow the same it must needs be derived to them also, and have such a high Priviledge annexed thereto, as the <hi>Throne of Israel</hi> never had, when a <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> sate thereon tho endued with ane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinare Unction; but if it respect the <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Holiness of the persons,</hi> it surely must ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this no less difficult, that not only such as <hi>King Henry the VIII.</hi> and his <hi>Daughter Queen
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:205487:52"/>Mary,</hi> besides many others, yea <hi>Richard the III.</hi> should on this account have the <hi>active faith of miracles,</hi> and be empoured herewith from God for working of the same: besides this it is known that the <hi>French Kings</hi> claim the same pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and power as peculiar to them alone, and may not on this ground <hi>Lewis the XIV</hi> this day be reckoned a fit instrument for such a <hi>healing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> and to bring a just repute and credit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. 3. But whence is it that such a <hi>hereditary gift</hi> should not faill, and be cutt off by the <hi>departure of England from the Romish Church,</hi> since the first holding hereof was upon their adherence to the same, and as a <hi>confirmatory Seall to the Romish Profession,</hi> or that it should now controll the end for which it was given; I know what some <hi>Popish Writers</hi> say hereon, that this miracle is not now performed by such who have apostatised from that faith, <hi>virtute propria, sed virtute signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crucis,</hi> but there needs no such <hi>Salvo,</hi> as to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon its being alienate now from serving for the same use, and end it did before, nor to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other rise if it were seriously pondered. 4. But what interest in this cure hath the use of such a <hi>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That within a little time, their eyes are to be for ever shut on this earth. and in one moment opened on that <hi>entry</hi> which is <hi>into another World,</hi> and on that hid, and marvelous <hi>passage,</hi> which lyes betwixt the <hi>earth,</hi> and the <hi>higher Paradise above, which is in the thrid Heavens,</hi> and will then know what it is to see with clear, and preceptible evidence ther <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi> and <hi>convoyance</hi> by the <hi>blessed Angels,</hi> and the manner of their <hi>ascent through these Aetherial Regions,</hi> in every step of the same, their begun acquaintance, and society with these <hi>glorious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> which shall be without fear, and conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as when they were in the <hi>body,</hi> and at last that unconceivable <hi>reception by the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> now is it possible, that men here on the earth can with assurance entertain their souls with such great things as before them, and near, and yet in an ordinare way converse with the same. 2. Is it a light or small thing to live in the Faith of such a <hi>Triumph,</hi> as is reserved to each of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:205487:55"/>Saints in the issue of their warefare, when the <hi>God of Peace shall tread Satan under their feet,</hi> and shall enter them into the <hi>overcomers joy,</hi> with that publick testimonie, <hi>well done good, and faithful servant &amp;c.</hi> before the whole Church of the redeemed there, and then to be called to a peculiar assignment of their <hi>room,</hi> and <hi>station</hi> in that <hi>blessed state</hi> answerable to their services and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of grace here, when they shall see the <hi>end of the Lord</hi> in his whole conduct and methods of providence about them within time, which once seemed incomprehensible to their thoughts. 3. Yea what is it to be in the serious exercise of such a <hi>Faith,</hi> that in a short time there shall be a <hi>final translation of the whole Church militant from this earth</hi> to <hi>these higher Regions of glory,</hi> where no more distance of place, and but one <hi>Church</hi> and Society for ever, where our <hi>blessed Redeemer shall then rejoice in his whole puchase,</hi> whom he had bought <hi>at so dear a price,</hi> and <hi>presented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot, or blemish unto the Father;</hi> and where the whole <hi>elect</hi> from <hi>Abell,</hi> the first of humane race, that entred Heaven, and the first member of the Church triumphant there, to the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And are there such now on the earth, who shall ere long see themselves in the same <hi>state</hi> and <hi>classe</hi> with the <hi>elect Angels,</hi> who could not in this <hi>state of mortality</hi> bear the sight, or apparition of one of these <hi>glorious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi>

Can it possibly be a subject of ordinare thoughts or assent, that men now on the earth, shall shortly see <hi>the glory</hi> and <hi>state of the last Judgment,</hi> and of their <hi>blessed Head on that Throne of His Majesty,</hi> yea thus see at once, the whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of men, and these who sometime were the greatest <hi>Monarchs</hi> here, presented then to be judged; and to see such a <hi>solemn particular,</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> judgment past on each according to their deeds, and work within time; and in that blessed <hi>order</hi> wherein the whole <hi>Saints,</hi> and each personally of these, having a distinct part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, shall be <hi>first acquitt, approven,</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> in the face of this <hi>great Assembly,</hi> with the publick testimony of the <hi>Judge,</hi> according to the <hi>measure of their service</hi> and <hi>tryalls for his sake,</hi> whilst they were in the World; and <hi>next</hi> in the <hi>condemnatory part of that Judgment</hi> to see the whole <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> who <hi>first sinned</hi> have the

            <p>But II. There is another thing with respect to this <hi>Subject,</hi> which hath been to me oft matter of <hi>serious thoughts,</hi> whence is it that in so knowing an <hi>age</hi> as this, we see how such as are greatest pretenders to <hi>reason, and to a higher flight</hi> then others this way are more visibly then any else of an <hi>Atheistick Spirit,</hi> and to be a length herein bejond any else on that <hi>design,</hi> how to <hi>weaken both their own assent,</hi> and <hi>others to the Christian Faith,</hi> and to render the same so far as possibly they can, to be <hi>problematick</hi> and <hi>doubtful;</hi> but it is sure here is nothing to <hi>stumble,</hi> but what may rather be <hi>strenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> to any of a serious spirit, and needs be no strange thing, when such are as tender as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to marr their enjoiments of this present
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:205487:57"/>life, who hath no more; or to let their thoughts come near to what must needs <hi>torment</hi> them <hi>before the time:</hi> whilst their <hi>reason</hi> serves them for such an <hi>use,</hi> and constrains their conscience herein, that they must either be <hi>Christians in earnest,</hi> or <hi>none at all,</hi> yea that under such bright discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the truth of the Ghospel, they must see it is not <hi>compatible with reason,</hi> how there should be a <hi>mids</hi> betwixt a truly <hi>serious Christian,</hi> who <hi>beleeves, what he does professe;</hi> and a <hi>rosolved Atheist</hi> whose work lyes to have the dread of such a <hi>Faith</hi> wholly extinguished. <q rend="inline">I knew a most remarkable <hi>Atheist</hi> indued with special natural accomplishments, who on the same account said to a person of quality, if I did truly beleeve what you profess to do, they are matters of so great concern, that I do profess I could think upon nothing else or be taken up thus, as the most of Christians are, with the things of this World; so as I cannot possibly credit you in the Faith of your own Profession.</q> And herein can any exerce reason, and not see the <hi>Faith of Christianity,</hi> is another thing, then most this day did ever conceive it to be, and a much higher attainment, then a <hi>Christians particular interest</hi> herein, for where the <hi>first</hi> is assuredly attained, it may seem not possible, but the <hi>other</hi> must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that mens greatest business of the earth, should be to have a sure <hi>evidence for Heaven,</hi> and to be ripening for so great a change. I have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:205487:57"/>known some whose tryalls, and conflicts in their warefare hath been extraordinare, and strange, who hath professed their highest releaf still lay herein, from the <hi>Faith of divine truth</hi> more then as to any <hi>particular promise made applicable to such a case,</hi> and would have sought no more to carry their spirits above the <hi>present temptations</hi> that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred though they were not ordinary, or to be at rest as to all <hi>temporal</hi> events, but a more full strenthning in the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and that their <hi>Redeemer did live,</hi> since then they were in <hi>sure terms,</hi> as to their <hi>security</hi> for whatever he hath promised.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But I must add yet one thing further which seems indeed a <hi>prodigy,</hi> proper to such an <hi>age as</hi> this, that its become so hard a work to bring men living in the <hi>day light of the Ghospel to a serious beleeving the truth, and existence of infernal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and of their commerce, and traffick with this visible World; or to bring such who seem greatest pretenders to reason, <hi>to the Faith of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells, lest they should thus be unavoidably brought to that Faith of the Divells, which is to beleeve, and tremble,</hi> which surely is an unconceavable and extream <hi>horror</hi> that these <hi>Apostate Spirits</hi> have herein, whilst their assent to the <hi>glorious beeing of God,</hi> to his <hi>attributes,</hi> yea to the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>History of the Ghospel,</hi> is by such ane inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table constraint, that as there is no possible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess for them to be <hi>Atheists,</hi> so is their <hi>dread,</hi> and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to strenthen such a way, and since such a party can have no help or support from <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> herein, and yet find the assured truth, and beeing of <hi>Divels,</hi> and of their communion, and warefare with men, does marr any possible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or design for <hi>Atheism,</hi> and a taking off the terror of ane <hi>infernal state,</hi> off their soul, they must therefore move to another airth, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to <hi>beleeve nothing but what they see and feell,</hi> and comes under a sensible demonstration to warrant the same: for this is to make sure work at once against the whole <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and shut the door on any way of conviction thence; thus they keep a distance with the beeing of their own <hi>souls,</hi> as if it were some dark, and abstract no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because it comes not under their <hi>sence;</hi> they can live at quiet, and be secure from the fear of a <hi>Hell,</hi> and <hi>infernal world,</hi> or exclusion out of <hi>Heaven</hi> untill they once meet with such an <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as to make them both <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>feell</hi> the truth hereof; but oh they seeme not to apprehend how sore the application of this <hi>argument</hi> will be, when they at last find its in vain to reject the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi> where the <hi>premises</hi> are sure. There is <hi>one</hi> of late, who is come forth in the day light of

               <p>IT may seem strange, not only the lengthning of this <hi>Discourse</hi> so far, but in insisting most spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon that <hi>Head of the internal Work, and Demonstrations of the Spirit of God on mens soul;</hi> but as I may with humble confidence say this was under the sense of some <hi>peculiar engagements to such a Subject;</hi> so I shall make this further <hi>Apology</hi> for the same. 1. That <hi>since ever I accounted the Profession of Christ a serious business,</hi> I have jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it not conceivable how <hi>Christians</hi> should have ane <hi>assent to the truth of the Ghospel</hi> or be at <hi>rest</hi> herein, untill it once be brought up to a <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>quieting assurance</hi> on that <hi>security,</hi> to which they must <hi>concredite themselves for ever,</hi> and thus know the <hi>strenth,</hi> and <hi>sureness of the foundation of their Faith</hi> by its <hi>own evidence;</hi> that tho it be not yet <hi>full,</hi> whilst we are here in <hi>the way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment,</hi>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:205487:60"/>yet is it undoubtedly <hi>full</hi> in the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>certainty of evidence;</hi> I have judged it also an <hi>addition to the greatest joy</hi> which I could have within time, whatever might be a further <hi>strenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to such a Faith,</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> we are called to by the <hi>Ghospel of Christ,</hi> so as not to lose any <hi>frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of this kind, which might tend to a more full establishment, and does reckon this the <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> and <hi>glory of our Religion,</hi> that in no other way it doth require <hi>acceptance</hi> of men, but with a <hi>full assurance of understanding,</hi> and the furthest conviction of evidence; as beeing designed no less to found a <hi>rational certainty in the judgment,</hi> then to <hi>determine the will or consent</hi> for embracing the same; yea on this account it hath been oft matter of astonishment, how in the <hi>teaching,</hi> and <hi>ministerial work,</hi> which God hath appointed for his Church, the <hi>primary truths of Religion</hi> should not be more held forth to men with that clearness of <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>demonstration,</hi> as such great, and marvelous things require, and the temper of this age calls for; or how the <hi>great things of God,</hi> that are of the <hi>highest consequence, and reality,</hi> can have any possible reception from men by ane im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite or ordinare assent; or whence it is, that with most it seemes their work seems wholly sett on the <hi>noetick,</hi> when so little on the <hi>dianoetick part</hi> of Divinity: but on the <hi>other hand</hi> I must also wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that if ever I knew what it was to attain ane <hi>inward assurance</hi> of the truth, and revelation of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:205487:61"/>Christ, and to be at rest herein; that the <hi>eternal Son of God was revealed from Heaven in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to save lost man,</hi> and that there is a <hi>state of grace here,</hi> and <hi>of glory hereafter;</hi> I have found that no <hi>light,</hi> or <hi>conviction of judgment,</hi> tho with such evidence as could leave no room for doubtfulness in the same, can effectually work without the <hi>internal evidence,</hi> and <hi>demonstration of the Spirit of God,</hi> and a supernatural power both to beget, and strengthen such a Faith in the soul; yea that without this, the furthest of <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective evidence</hi> to cause irresistably a clear and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional assurance of divine truth, tho it were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a <hi>dispensation of miracles,</hi> will not <hi>quiet the Spirit</hi> of such, who under <hi>some deep ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi> may be haunted with <hi>hid,</hi> and <hi>dreadful temptations to infidelity,</hi> until they know the truth of a <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>evidence,</hi> as goes above any <hi>moral influence.</hi> It is true this is not expressible to others, and they must <hi>come and see,</hi> who would know in what manner the <hi>Spirit of God bears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> to his own truth, and what <hi>strong impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion his work hath on the internal Senses of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> yea what <hi>piercing intelligences</hi> are betwixt such, who surely know, and are partakers of a <hi>divine life,</hi> and their <hi>blessed Head</hi> in this state of mortality, but if this were not known and sure, we might say ane established Christian whose work is to <hi>follow the Lord fully,</hi> and adventure with assurance upon him, is such as might be

It hath prest me to insist more on this <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> that this <hi>way</hi> is so visibly gathering strength, and seems to have the greatest prevalence now in the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> how to divide the <hi>moral part</hi> of our Religion in the duties and services
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:205487:62"/>thereof, from its <hi>internal and vital part,</hi> so as this mortal contagion hath got in on the light and principles of this Generation, that if there were not an absolute assurance by the promise of God, we might fear truth and piety should quickly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish from the earth. Oh what a strange &amp; prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious opposition is this! against the whole <hi>internal work &amp; vitals</hi> of that <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>excellent Religion,</hi> wherein both the comfort and glory of humane state lyes, &amp; how is't conceivable men should be here capable of converse with God in the spirit, if there were not a conformity to him in the same kind by a <hi>participation of the divine nature;</hi> yea if there were not so rare a being on the earth as the <hi>new man, which is born of God,</hi> and his immediate workmanship, which hath its peculiar grouth &amp; <hi>vital acts</hi> proper thereto, and in that sence as it's contradistinguished from the <hi>old man cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly sin it self,</hi> tho it be formed in the heart of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and hath it's being therein, no more then the <hi>life of God,</hi> which is a partaking of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can put forth any act of sin, but hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued conflict therewith; and thus tends to give the clear sence of that Scripture 1 <hi>John</hi> 5:18. <hi>we know that whatever is born of God sinneth not,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rom</hi> 7:20. <hi>It is no more I, but sin that duelleth is me, nam unumquodque operatur secundum sua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But though I must decline an answer to what you are pleased more particularly to propose, under a just sence of my unfitness herein, yet so far as I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the matter of light upon a more general account with respect to the <hi>Work of God in these
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:205487:63"/>great changes past,</hi> I am free to impart my self, and to offer humbly some few thoughts on such a <hi>Subject,</hi> which hath had most special evidence and weight on my spirit in the present day.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I doubt not you make the same Judgment, and reckoning of this with more advantage then I can reach, that one of the most choise and weighty exercises of a Christian, whilst he is within time, lyes in a <hi>deep and serious observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the times</hi> he is fall'n in, not only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the administration of Providence in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, but what does more eminently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the <hi>Churches of Christ,</hi> and where their lott is cast; since this is ane essential part of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as it's also one of the most choise of humane excellencies, to discern and <hi>observe wisely</hi> the ways of the Lord. But I can only shew you some of these things in a short touch, which I have found most engaging to such an Inquiry in this day. 1. That as each distinct <hi>age</hi> hath a proper <hi>Talent</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereto, under trust for observation of such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of Providence, wherein the name of God is more near unto men in any singular way, then in the ordinare course of his actings, so hath the great <hi>Author of time</hi> choised to put a <hi>higher Glory upon one age,</hi> and <hi>period of time, then another,</hi> wherein it might be said that the measure of one is <hi>five Talents,</hi> as to more solemn appearances of the Majesty of God in his Providential Actings, when the measure of other times hath been this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:205487:63"/>way but as <hi>two Talents.</hi> Such a differencing marke had that <hi>age of the Churches coming out of Egypt,</hi> beyond all which had gone before; yet was this comparatively little with respect to that glory, which was reserved to the <hi>fulness of time,</hi> when our blest Redeemer did appear to the World. And it's clear how in these later times, that <hi>age</hi> which had it's first entry from the <hi>Year</hi> 15 17. had a higher splendor put thereon, then had been known for a <hi>thousand Years</hi> preceeding the same; but when I have thought on the way and conduct of Providence, and marvelous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of God herein to this Generation, I could not but see something in a most singular way of his appearance before the World to the same, as seems but yet little understood, tho this may be seen, that we have surely lived in an <hi>age of wonders</hi> 2. I have lookt on such an exercise, to <hi>discern, and understand a right the times we are in,</hi> as one of the most singular means for strenthning a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Faith</hi> on the certainty of sacred truth; when with these more immediate discoveries of God in the way and administration of grace by his spirit on mens sonll, which is wholly hid from the World, they can see in what manner his truth does visibly take place, and is attested by an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal seall</hi> in the glory of his work before men, and I am perswaded none thus did ever persue a more near acquaintance with God, but hath had some peculiar strengthning remarks of his way,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:205487:64"/>that have been hid from others, tho of a serious spirit otherwise. 3. It is such who have some greater weight of this choise study, and their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits more fully join'd in therewith then others, who may attain more clear discoveries of light, for directing them to the <hi>duties</hi> and <hi>work of such a time;</hi> and on this account I fear that there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> much yet this day in the dark to us, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, what hath been the <hi>Voice of the Lord</hi> for answering the great ends of his Providence, tho it hath been clear and distinct, where mens spirits were laid open to entertain the same. I confess it is not strange as to the greatest part of men this day, tho they keep at the furthest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from what might bring near an affecting sense of a Godhead to their soull in the ways of Providence, who are resolute not to see, or be perswaded of what doeth torment them hereby, whose great study is to <hi>live without God in the World,</hi> and seem emulous of these who can be most ingenious and expert, to confirm their hearts against all that is sacred. 4. But I am sure, it is something much higher then any interest of men or of Nations, or the greatest changes in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of humane affairs, which should bear the greatest weight in this exercise to understand the times we are in, and for a suitable observation thereof, if men could once reckon that their great business in the earth lyes with God, and in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sight of him in the outgoings of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:205487:64"/>since the <hi>hidden wisdom of God in a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> is to be seen and sought out in his <hi>Works,</hi> as well as in his <hi>Word;</hi> it's true <hi>publick Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and the fall and setting up of great men are things highly observable and momentous, but they are neither seen or understood, when they make not way for some greater sight of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of God,</hi> and the signal <hi>retaliations of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> herein, &amp; what peculiar aspects such strange Revolutions of Providence hath on the <hi>present Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Though it might seem unsuitable to offer any special Remarkes and <hi>Observations</hi> upon this <hi>late time,</hi> to one of so discerning a spirit, of things of that nature; yet knowing how a mutual communication of light, about the Work of God, and his actings in our day, is so incumbent a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I shall point at a few things, wherein I have desired to admire and observe the way of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this <hi>remarkable age,</hi> but in the first place more generally touch such a <hi>Head,</hi> ere I speak in some particular way thereto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When we see the <hi>series of these times,</hi> and different measures of tryall and service assigned thereto, since that blessed rise, and recovery of the Church from Antichristian darkness, there might be seen also a <hi>growing increase of light,</hi> which in this <hi>age</hi> hath had such ane advance, as it could not but be expected, that the Lord was to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kesome higher proofs of the improvements thereof
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:205487:65"/>from this Generation then of these past, after such great things he had done for a full settlement of the <hi>Reformed Churches;</hi> when he had opened the <hi>graves</hi> of his people, and sent forth his <hi>Prisoners by the blood of the Covenant,</hi> &amp; the truth had made way for its self over <hi>mountains,</hi> which once seem'd insuperable; yea when this also is an <hi>age,</hi> where in a great concurrence of the <hi>Prayers of the Saints</hi> in times before, was to meet for the Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; so that, unanswerableness to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of God herein, and to frustrate such emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent methods of grace, might expect some unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual work of Judgment to follow thereon, and the Lords coming at last to a judicial proces and procedure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We seehow these extraordinar occurrences of this <hi>time past,</hi> hath most remarkably had a joint respect both to <hi>Sacred, and Civil Interests, &amp; quoad Fata Ecclesiae, &amp; Imperii humani,</hi> so as in that sence it might be said there hath been a <hi>shaking both of Heaven and Earth,</hi> as to the Churches visible State; yea such hath these <hi>great changes</hi> from the right hand of the most high been within the measure of <hi>one age,</hi> as men could not possibly see with the eye of reason, without ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sement, tho it brings therewith one of the most dismal remarks of the present time, if mens spirits be not seiled with a deep and awful sense of the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Majesty of God herein, and know there is no stability of humane state this day in the earth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:205487:65"/>but from him alone, who can bring judgement on the greatest <hi>Nations,</hi> or <hi>Persons,</hi> above the common course of nature, and influence of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes: but oh what intertainment should a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pensation of <hi>Miracles</hi> find from the spirits of men now, when the <hi>Revelation of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Redemption by his Blood</hi> from Eternal Wrath, hath no greater effects on this <hi>Generation,</hi> and so few awak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d with the Glory of such a light.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When I have considered this <hi>age,</hi> as that which might have been judged a time of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation for a further advance of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in the World, which does specially make a time more remarkable, yet how little access hath been herein to see the <hi>Work of God</hi> in any <hi>new planting of Churches,</hi> or <hi>inbrirging of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to the Profession of the Ghospel, as hath been formerly, but instead of <hi>new Conquest,</hi> rather a losing ground, and is a difficult part become to maintain a <hi>defensive work</hi> in behalf of the truth, and which may be a serious remark that in this <hi>age,</hi> one tribe hath as it were been cut off from the Reformed Churches; I mean as to that dismal State of <hi>Bohem,</hi> where some time before had been so eminent and flourishing a plantation; it is true there hath been a solemn <hi>tide of the effusion of the Spirit of God,</hi> allotted to some of the Churches in this last age, that should be still matter of sweet remembrance, but it's sure this day we see the <hi>ebb</hi> as low in these places, in the life and power of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:205487:66"/>Religion, and no visible reviving almost any where can be heard of the <hi>Churches of Christ;</hi> which yet hath been to me so far a hopeful <hi>sign</hi> of a near <hi>incalling of the Jews,</hi> since it will then find the <hi>Gentile Church</hi> in so judicial a Period of time, that it shall be as <hi>life from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Yet it is sure on the other hand there hath been most signal honor and glory put on this <hi>age,</hi> and with a special respect to <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in as great a harvest of serious and solid Christians by the Power of the Ghospel, then hath been in any time or place of the Earth, since the first <hi>three Centuries;</hi> tho not under that seall of Martyrdom as was after the Reformation, yet such who shined in the truth and power of true Sanctity, and have left a fragrant Savour and remembrance to this day, when most of that blessed stock it now gone, and their room rarely filled up any where.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Yea this further may be matter of sweet <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,</hi> how many such hath been in this <hi>age,</hi> in whom that ancient greatness of spirit with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roïck motions in appearing for God, and his truth might be seen; for tho they attained not to the <hi>measure of the first three,</hi> of our first and bless'd Reformers, yet may it be said, within the limits of this <hi>age,</hi> there hath gone off the stage innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable instances of such eminency of indue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and with that measure of power, and of a sound mind, as might be compared with any of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:205487:66"/>the <hi>Antients</hi> since the <hi>Apostolick times;</hi> and this is a remark that never faills of Christs imparting himself in these measures of his spirit to a <hi>Church</hi> in such a time, according to the great <hi>ends</hi> he is to accomplish there.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Though <hi>great changes upon a Nation or Church,</hi> does not want previous and remarkable warnings from the Lord, we have seen with what a marvelous <hi>Surprisal</hi> these have occurred to this Generation, that were most remote from all humane thoughts, and once not conceivable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the highest principles of reason, how ever they should have taken place. It is becoming the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of God, to have his <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> in such peculiar and reserved cases, as the most skilled in the ways and depths of Providence are called to be still with a silent admiration, when he thus does arise, as in these times past, to do great things which was not looked for.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But how strange and marvelous hath the <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisalls</hi> been of Providence in our day also in the way of tenderness, and mercy, as well as of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which should be a most strengthning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, if this had been more suitably improven; what unexpected and seasonable interpositions have been of a divine immediate power, in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme exigences,</hi> both of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Christians,</hi> in these great changes past; and as <hi>Oppressors</hi> have grown up to a height of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, how observably have <hi>Carpenters</hi> been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:205487:67"/>whence humane reason could not have fore seen to cut the <hi>horns</hi> of such.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When we can not but see with what a signal evidence and commission, the spotless Judgment of God hath gone forth in these late times, to all ranks and stations of men, especially in the <hi>Isle of Britain,</hi> there might be also some peculiar remarke of it's design against these, who were of the <hi>highest Staie,</hi> so as no time past did ever tend more to <hi>seall instruction</hi> on the spirits of great men then of late, to have the fear and dread of God on them, when <hi>Princes might have been seen walking on foot, and Servants riding on horscback;</hi> yea that there is a time of <hi>Gods making inquisition for blood,</hi> of such who seemed most secure from humane Power, and how this alone comes from a divine hand, when men are <hi>poisoned in their own cup,</hi> and lays a snare to themself by which they are caught; it is true a clear <hi>application of Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces past,</hi> to the <hi>present times,</hi> is not easily attained, but I doubt not of a more full light and discovery for this end, as will silence all oppositions, that have been to the intent and Counsell of the Lord in these things which have occurred.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It hath been reserved to our day, to see the <hi>Issue,</hi> and <hi>great Decisions,</hi> which have been in these strange <hi>Scenes</hi> of Providence, in this age past, and to have them now in our sight in the whole successive course thereof, and surely this might be a great and affecting sight to such who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:205487:67"/>are ready to think that God hath forsaken the earth, and walketh only in the circuit of Heaven, when they cannot but see what amasing events hath been of late brought forth by an invisible and unpreventable conduct of Providence; and to see also in this late Revolution of the publick State of <hi>Britain,</hi> how by one <hi>great surprisal,</hi> the whole <hi>Popish Measures</hi> there which had been of so long and painful a contrivance, was as in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment broke and made void, when nothing less expected.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It is unquestionable, that the Lord does usually act by <hi>second causes,</hi> but there are steps also of his way wherein he alone appears, and will have them seen to be wholly his work, &amp; this now hath eminently appeared in the great transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these <hi>late times,</hi> how bejond any humane power or might, it was a <hi>Standard by the Spirit of God lifted up,</hi> that did visibly make way for the work he was then accomplishing, and did serve such terror on his Adversaries; yea how these who were acted forth to be instrumental thus on the service of their day, were directed for that great end to the <hi>quieting of his Spirit</hi> in such a piece of his Work.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And herewith what thoughts of heart may it cause now in the present state and juncture of things, to see such a <hi>Conjunction</hi> in this <hi>Western Part of Europe,</hi> to serve the great ends of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that if it had been told our Fathers by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:205487:68"/>any, they would have been as such who mock, that in the next age, the <hi>House of Austria, of Spain, Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> should have a joint interest with the greatest <hi>Princes of the Reformed Religion,</hi> and take the Sword with one consent against such a Party, whose Sword hath been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and yet still is reaking in the blood of the Protestants, yea how this great instrument of Judgment, and <hi>Patron of the Romish Interest</hi> should most actively make way to defeat his own Projects and Counsel, by an irresistable conduct of Providence.</p>
            <p>This is a great and unusual <hi>Conjunction</hi> in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, such as the Policy of the <hi>Western Part of Christendom</hi> is hereby cast in a new mould, wherein we are called to adore God, and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all <hi>Second Causes;</hi> tho it be a <hi>Depth of Providence,</hi> which is yet not opened up; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly herewith some <hi>Reflections</hi> on the same I cannot wholly pass. 1. What may be too justly feared of an inordinate respect to men, and concurrence of visible means, above what it can bear, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more effectual to cause the greatest hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane succor miscarry, and sink under this <hi>weight,</hi> the relyances thereon, as if they could stand by them self, without keeping in with <hi>God</hi> alone, with that <hi>God,</hi> who is of infinite Power both to hurt &amp; help, whose presence is ever the highest Security of a <hi>Nation,</hi> tho the whole World were against them. 2. But this also looks with confidence &amp; hope, that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:205487:68"/>the Lord is near to give some extraordinar demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of himself by <hi>Providences,</hi> as this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall not get their eyes shut at, yea that this strange piece of his work, is a prelude and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on a revolution of the publick State of the World, that shall be of a higher extent, then may be apprehended by most, and it's sure when he does begin, he will also make an end. 3. I have lookt on this remarkable <hi>silence,</hi> and <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence</hi> as to any <hi>publick Decision of Providence, this Year past,</hi> when things seemed to be in the highest <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

               </gap>
               <hi>of a Crisis,</hi> that hereby the Lord would yet give men time to consider his Work, and take to heart his Voice by such a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>warning;</hi> and have still observed from the records of times past, as to his Procedure, that when he was to bring forth some great piece of his Work before the World, there hath been as it were an interval of silence for a time, &amp; like some <hi>Cessation</hi> of Providence, which hath preceeded the same, and made the time of his <hi>Working,</hi> when it was lest mens <hi>Expectation;</hi> yea the sorer a stroak hath been when it came, the longer hath a tender forbearance gone before, even when the <hi>band of Justice</hi> hath been lift up, the <hi>wheels some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times stand still,</hi> and the publick state of affairs is in a strange manner becalm'd when the Lord is in some eminent manner to arise according to that <hi>Isay</hi> 42:14. <hi>I have long time holden my peace, I have be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> III. <hi>Head on this Subject,</hi> that I would offer some thoughts on, is as to the <hi>Lords singular way of dealing with the publick State of Britain, and Ireland</hi> bejond any other of the <hi>Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> in this <hi>last age;</hi> and is indeed a <hi>Subject</hi> of serious regard, to consider what <hi>manner of time</hi> hath our lot been cast in, and the <hi>measure of that talent</hi> for <hi>observation,</hi> we stand accountable for upon such great and extraordinare <hi>events</hi> as hath occurred: but here I have desired to have my thoughts <hi>translate,</hi> to what hath been from the <hi>first entry</hi> on so marvelous a <hi>series of providence,</hi> about the state of these <hi>Nations,</hi> for almost <hi>fifty
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:205487:71"/>Years past,</hi> for a more clear prospect how each <hi>step</hi> herein in its <hi>successive place,</hi> and <hi>room,</hi> hath tended to give <hi>light</hi> to another; which I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict wholly to the more <hi>immediate appearances of God,</hi> from what hath been <hi>mens part,</hi> and actings upon such a <hi>diversity of interests</hi> as might too visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be seen to influence many in their <hi>way;</hi> and <hi>offer</hi> but a <hi>few</hi> serious <hi>reflections</hi> on the same, to one who can more clearly <hi>observe,</hi> and discern things of that kind.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it's sure <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland hath been of late a Theater of such strange and extraordinare vicissitudes in it's publick state,</hi> from the <hi>Year</hi> 38. <hi>of this age,</hi> as in no times past can be resembled; what <hi>wonderful Revolutions</hi> did then successively follow other, and were made the <hi>object of mens sense,</hi> as could not possibly have had credit or been a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> if the same should have been foretold, and may justly render such a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time</hi> unto this <hi>day,</hi> to be matter of astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any of a serious spirit. It is true there is no <hi>time</hi> wherein the Lord hath not given some more <hi>singular discoveries of himself,</hi> and these <hi>changes of providence</hi> which are in the <hi>personal case of Christians,</hi> and lyes more close and near to their <hi>Sense,</hi> then things of a <hi>publick concern,</hi> are oft so extraordinare as would be not easy for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to credit; but it must be said what we have seen here, and may know of the work and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:205487:72"/>of God in that <hi>Land</hi> can never be a <hi>Subject of ordinary thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is known how ane <hi>avenging Sword,</hi> which was <hi>bathed in Heaven,</hi> had it's <hi>commission thence,</hi> to go forth against both <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and did not <hi>cease</hi> to persue it's end until these <hi>flourishing Nations,</hi> was made a visible <hi>field of blood,</hi> yea did not <hi>rest,</hi> until in the righteous, and Soveraign disposal of God, a <hi>potent</hi> and <hi>sett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Monarchy</hi> there, of a <hi>long descent</hi> having no fear, or opposition from any <hi>forren power,</hi> was yet <hi>broke,</hi> and made <hi>void,</hi> and did fall in their <hi>high places;</hi> and what ane account this should have been to the World, if it could have been possibly seen or judged in the <hi>Year</hi> 40. what the 50 <hi>Year</hi> following was to bring forth, and was then in the bosome of so short a time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But when thus the <hi>Lord did once appear,</hi> and go forth in a <hi>judiciary way,</hi> we might see how each of these <hi>three Nations had their proper share,</hi> and measure allotted in the <hi>strokes,</hi> and <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of that time, tho in some different method and manner; there beeing a more singular part assigned to <hi>poor Ireland</hi> then, by the Holy and just God in that <hi>bloody and terrible Scene,</hi> which was acted there, yet this was in <hi>common</hi> to the <hi>whole of these Lands</hi> that it was an <hi>intestine Sword,</hi> and not of a <hi>forreiner</hi> that was then call'd for, which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:205487:72"/>spoke the <hi>Judgment</hi> to be the sorer and more of divine wrath in it; where on part of a <hi>Nation,</hi> is made the <hi>rod,</hi> and <hi>executioner of his judgment on another,</hi> and their <hi>destruction</hi> from <hi>amongst themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If it be considered, what <hi>manner of time,</hi> that was of so <hi>extraordinare things,</hi> it may be <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,</hi> how this followed a <hi>long and unusal sett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led calm,</hi> and <hi>tranquillity,</hi> which had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>publick State of these Nations,</hi> when so great a <hi>flame</hi> had been round about; it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after a <hi>bloody Sword</hi> had done its work in <hi>Germany,</hi> which from the <hi>Year</hi> 30. had brought with it such dismal effects there; but what would seem most <hi>astonishing</hi> here, that tho a <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>long suffering of God,</hi> had in a singular manner gone before, &amp; the <hi>treaty of the Ghospel</hi> might be seen to have a small accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and such <hi>judicial effects,</hi> with most of that <hi>Generation,</hi> when the <hi>Red Horse,</hi> and its <hi>Rider</hi> went forth to <hi>take peace</hi> from such a part of the <hi>earth,</hi> yet was not the <hi>hight of Profanity, and Atheism nor measure of sin then in these Nations</hi> come near to such a <hi>degree,</hi> as is now the <hi>measure of this time,</hi> or had any such <hi>prodigious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> only we see not yet what is <hi>coming</hi> to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. It is not above 40 <hi>Years past,</hi> since we might see a <hi>powerful state,</hi> &amp; <hi>commonwealth</hi> both <hi>raised</hi> and <hi>formed</hi> in <hi>these Nations</hi> on <hi>so great a ruine,</hi> had

It was upon some <hi>serious thoughts</hi> hereof, and this <hi>present State</hi> of things, I <hi>sett my self,</hi> for more clear discerning of the <hi>way of the Lord</hi> and his <hi>voice to this generation</hi> in these <hi>astonishing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:205487:79"/>changes</hi> hath gone over the same <hi>of late,</hi> to have <hi>my own spirit fix'd</hi> herein, and some higher strenthning on the <hi>faithfulnes of his truth;</hi> but in the <hi>first place,</hi> there are some undoubted <hi>principles of truth,</hi> which I would mention here, and must <hi>hold by,</hi> as <hi>truths</hi> which are of ane <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall verity,</hi> and may have a clear <hi>applicatory light,</hi> to the <hi>present day</hi> we are in.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it's sure, the <hi>most notable mercies</hi> which hath been bequathed of the <hi>Lord,</hi> either to <hi>churches,</hi> or <hi>persons,</hi> have also been an <hi>entry to the greatest of judgements,</hi> when <hi>not answered,</hi> it was with the brightest sunshine of ane <hi>immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his hand,</hi> and ane <hi>extraordinary course of miracles,</hi> that <hi>Israel, entred into the wilderness;</hi> whereon so black a night of <hi>dismal providences</hi> did fall; and is it not the same <hi>voice</hi> which is now speaking to us, that we have <hi>Malach.</hi> 2.2. <hi>if ye will not lay to heart, to give glory to my name, says the Lord of host, I will curse your blessings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It stands ever <hi>sure,</hi> and <hi>unchangeable,</hi> that <hi>God will never return to a people,</hi> against whom he is wroth, until <hi>the cause of his departure be taken away,</hi> for both the same <hi>date,</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> which mens <hi>forsaking of God,</hi> doth <hi>bear,</hi> the same also does <hi>his departing bear</hi> unto them, and tho <hi>repentance</hi> where it is in truth, can never be in vain, yet may it come to <hi>late,</hi> to <hi>prevent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral judgment,</hi> or to regain ever again, a <hi>season
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:205487:80"/>of acting for God,</hi> when there is a more eminent <hi>call</hi> thereto, at <hi>one time,</hi> then <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is ane <hi>unchangeable truth,</hi> which varies not, with the changes of time, <hi>that there is no condition on the earth can be safe</hi> whither as to a a <hi>Nation,</hi> or <hi>Person,</hi> were it never at such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in external things; <hi>wherein they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, God is with us herein,</hi> and <hi>we are desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for him;</hi> as on the other hand, it must be founded wholly on <hi>Atheism,</hi> where the <hi>state;</hi> and <hi>danger of a Nation is not judged from, the sins</hi> thereof, and the <hi>measure</hi> of the same, more then from any <hi>visible hazard;</hi> for tho particular <hi>places,</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> under a Profession of Christ, comes not to the same <hi>hight in filling up the measure of sin;</hi> yet it must surely have it's <hi>fatal period,</hi> when <hi>deferred Judgment</hi> will nat stay on <hi>day</hi> longer.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What ever uncertainty be in humane things, yet is this <hi>unchangeable,</hi> and <hi>sure,</hi> that <hi>such who inherit the same sins of others,</hi> against whom <hi>God</hi> hath appeared in any <hi>eminency</hi> of <hi>Providence shall inherit the same Judgements,</hi> which hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been measured out to such as hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but are <hi>pledges to after times</hi> of what may be expected. For as the <hi>way of grace,</hi> changeth not, and the <hi>redeem'd of the Lord, as dear to him now, as ever;</hi> so is he <hi>immutably just,</hi> and his ways keeps the same measure with his revealed truth, so as a <hi>Solid Interpretation of Scripture</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:205487:80"/>needs no extraordinare <hi>Prophetik Spirit,</hi> to <hi>infer Judgment,</hi> from <hi>sin,</hi> where there is no serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning unto him, and <hi>when the Lord God hath spoken, who can but Prophecy Amos</hi> 3:8.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is of unquestionable evidence also, that <hi>national sins,</hi> wherein the <hi>body of a Nation,</hi> and <hi>People is unite,</hi> and hath a joint acceession herein; when it is thus the <hi>publick Sin of a Community,</hi> must meet with a <hi>Stroke,</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> within time of as <hi>publick extent,</hi> and cannot be laid over in <hi>this respect to the Judgment of the great day,</hi> when once it's <hi>measure is filled up here;</hi> since else the <hi>Glory of God in his truth,</hi> and <hi>remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Justice,</hi> should not have on such an account, a <hi>Vindication</hi> before the World, in the <hi>sight of Angels,</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> if his <hi>spotless Judgment</hi> should not thus bear some <hi>proportion,</hi> to the <hi>nature of that guilt;</hi> the <hi>God of truth</hi> hath given his <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> over <hi>Nations</hi> both to <hi>pluke up,</hi> and to <hi>plant,</hi> as well as over <hi>persons,</hi> which can never be made void.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There can be no doubtfulness here also that it is simply impossible for a <hi>church to subsist,</hi> or <hi>preserve it's station</hi> in a <hi>Church state</hi> by a naked <hi>external form</hi> only; or in the <hi>purity of religion,</hi> without some <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> of the same; fince if there were no reall <hi>inbringing,</hi> or <hi>building</hi> up of the <hi>elect</hi> there, then the <hi>Gospel</hi> had no more work in the same, and no <hi>interest</hi> were there for the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> to keep fellowship with, so that

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:205487:81"/>was an eminent return to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinar act of condescendence, that makes no <hi>rule.</hi> There was a choise and numerous <hi>remnant</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> who sought the Lord then, when that dismal night of the <hi>Captivity</hi> came on; and it is of late, that such a <hi>tremendous instance,</hi> we have before us in the <hi>Case of Bohemia,</hi> where so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicous a part then was of a <hi>People zealous for God,</hi> when such a <hi>publick overwhelming stroke</hi> came on.</p>
            <p>But now in the <hi>Second Place</hi> I must speak a <hi>few words</hi> to what seems in some singular way, to speak to <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> by very sad, and <hi>monitory signs,</hi> bejond any of the Churches ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: it is, I know, easie, and usual to challenge the <hi>darkness of Providence,</hi> more then to regard, what is clearly revealed to us as the <hi>intent</hi> &amp; <hi>voice</hi> thereof; and these are indeed sad, and dismal like <hi>dispensations,</hi> that tho they be not <hi>silent,</hi> but have a <hi>distinct,</hi> and <hi>audible voice,</hi> yet <hi>Seals no Instruction</hi> herewith, on the spirits of men. I confess a <hi>natural Respect,</hi> and <hi>tye,</hi> to such a <hi>Part of the earth,</hi> bejond any else, renders this to some, to be more <hi>heavie,</hi> and <hi>dreadful</hi> that if <hi>Soveraign grace,</hi> do not wonderfully interpose, it cannot be found in the <hi>course of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> since the beginning of time; that ever the <hi>measure of sin, contempt of a Deity,</hi> and <hi>oppositions to the Holy God in the designs</hi> both of his <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> hath come to such a hight as is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:205487:82"/>in these <hi>Churches</hi> this day; but that some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinare <hi>appearance of Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> from the <hi>Lord</hi> hath as <hi>visiby followed thereon,</hi> to be a <hi>publick monument,</hi> for <hi>after times,</hi> wherein these <hi>Remarks,</hi> are so unavoidable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To what a <hi>strange,</hi> and <hi>fatal issue,</hi> hath that <hi>purest profession of Christ,</hi> in the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> which hath been long enjoyed there, now come, when such <hi>publik contempt,</hi> and <hi>scorn,</hi> is thrown upon the same, in the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> thereof, as a matter of their greatest abhorrence; when the most numerous part of the <hi>multitude,</hi> every where may be seen in a <hi>stated opposition</hi> to the <hi>dominion,</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of God in his <hi>laws,</hi> yea such <hi>horrid tenets,</hi> as well as <hi>practices,</hi> even in the common sense of mankind, may be discernable there, as in <hi>pagan nations,</hi> under some aw, and restraint of a <hi>natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> would be affrigting; since <hi>every nation will walk in the name of their God;</hi> but these are such as have at once divested themselves of all <hi>hope</hi> and cast off all <hi>fear, or dread,</hi> of a <hi>wrath that is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And as to one special <hi>evidence</hi> hereof, what cause may it be to <hi>meditate terror,</hi> as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of <hi>these nations,</hi> when a <hi>spirit of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> is let forth there and gott such a prevalence amongst all <hi>ranks,</hi> as it's accounted a matter of <hi>fashion,</hi> and <hi>breading,</hi> to go a length bejond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in tearing that <hi>blessed name of God,</hi> in

               <hi>whose hand is their breath,</hi> by <hi>profane,</hi> and <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous oaths.</hi> This is a thing by it self, that's <hi>purely diabolick,</hi> and hath nothing <hi>humane</hi> in it, can have no affinity with the flesh, nor is as ane <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie degree,</hi> of a <hi>reall possession by the Divel,</hi> and much sadder, then that which hath been on many by <hi>constraint,</hi> and putting a force upon their <hi>ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> to <hi>blaspheme,</hi> which otherwise would have been a <hi>horror,</hi> and dread, since this is by <hi>consent,</hi> and a <hi>delight,</hi> that could have no possible rise, but from pure <hi>enmity to the Holy God,</hi> yet is it now come to such a prodigious height, as if Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain did design a <hi>proper monopoly</hi> this <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>Preheminence,</hi> of the same, <hi>above all nations of the earth;</hi> tho none more will prete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But what a <hi>symptome,</hi> is this herewith of <hi>approaching judgments</hi> when to such a hight, and so universalie, the <hi>corruption</hi> of <hi>the youth,</hi> is in this <hi>day,</hi> and <hi>these parts,</hi> in so ane usual a way; and among such, a <hi>Spirit of Atheism,</hi> and <hi>profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:205487:83"/>is in that manner got up, as may be sadly foreseen, what a <hi>dismal night</hi> must follow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cause these know, whose respects see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to run so high for a <hi>national interest,</hi> that what does thus <hi>strike,</hi> at the <hi>root, truth</hi> &amp; <hi>Godliness,</hi> amongst men, in so strange a <hi>debauchery,</hi> of the <hi>generation that's coming up,</hi> gives the same <hi>stroke,</hi> to the greatest <hi>security of government,</hi> and to what founds the greatest obligations, to <hi>civil,</hi> or <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties;</hi> yea hath a native, and unavoidable tendence to ruine the <hi>politick bodie,</hi> to <hi>emasculate the spirits of men,</hi> and <hi>obstruct the vigorous improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of their natural parts,</hi> and will in a short time depress, and change the <hi>very genius</hi> of these once <hi>renouned nations,</hi> if there be no <hi>due applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> of the <hi>proper,</hi> and <hi>adequate remedie</hi> for the same.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And do we not with too great <hi>evidence</hi> now see, how much that <hi>old Protestant spirit,</hi> which was in the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>life of that profession,</hi> is gone, and extinguished this day; before which the <hi>Romish interest</hi> could not, possibly stand, when <hi>humane power</hi> and <hi>might</hi> did litle concur therewith; so as it may be a strange but too visible a <hi>remark,</hi> how that <hi>distinction,</hi> hath got such place in <hi>Britain,</hi> bejond any other <hi>reformed churches</hi> else, which is betwixt the <hi>Protestant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> and <hi>politick concerns</hi> thereof, and the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> which lyes in the <hi>pure doctrine of Christ,</hi> in its <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>efficacy on mens soul,</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:205487:83"/>and <hi>practice;</hi> when thus may be seen, what a throng and easie concurrence is there to <hi>promote the one,</hi> and bear the highest respects thereto, so far as they find a <hi>private interest,</hi> and <hi>external motives</hi> renders this necessary, who does <hi>hate,</hi> and to the utmost <hi>oppose themselves to the other;</hi> yea fears nothing more, then to have this get any <hi>authority over their conscience;</hi> and oh thence it is that when <hi>priveledge</hi> and <hi>propertie</hi> upon a temporal interest, are as the <hi>apple of mens eye,</hi> when these are once touched, yet are the highest <hi>indignities,</hi> and <hi>affronts to the honor of God,</hi> and to his <hi>truth</hi> of a small regard.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But if we yet look further, in to the <hi>Publick State of Religion</hi> in these <hi>Churches,</hi> there may be a more astonishing <hi>sight,</hi> and of <hi>greater abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> still, answerable to <hi>that vision Ezechiel</hi> 8; when within the precincts of a <hi>Christian Church,</hi> once so purely <hi>reformed,</hi> such a <hi>party</hi> is got up and growing, whose work is not onlie to take men off the serious work, and power of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> but to subvert wholly the <hi>foundation of</hi> our <hi>faith,</hi> under that late designation of <hi>Deists,</hi> and that men are now become so wearied of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Profession,</hi> as were their power answerable to their will, they would bring in a new model of <hi>paganism,</hi> and fix themself at last there. And oh is it come to such a day, after so bright a sun shine of the Gospell hath gone before, and after so great ane <hi>effusion of the Spirit of God,</hi> that such
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:205487:84"/>a party should be upon the encrease in so horrid an appearance, were it possible, to make void the whole <hi>frame of the Gospel,</hi> to justle our ever <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Redeemer,</hi> who once was the <hi>desire of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> off his throne, to thrust the <hi>crown off his head,</hi> the <hi>scepter of whose government</hi> is <hi>righteousness,</hi> &amp; <hi>peace;</hi> and give, if they could, a mortall stroke to him, who is the <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>light of men,</hi> and by <hi>whose stripes we are healed,</hi> yea as if they could make their party good against that rod of iron, with which he bears rule over his adversaries. But what can these design to themselves to render <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane being</hi> desirable here on the <hi>earth,</hi> except to have a share of the same priveledge, with the <hi>beasts,</hi> of <hi>the field,</hi> that within a little they should have no more <hi>being,</hi> and oh <hi>what a God</hi> does such deprive themselves of who only <hi>propitious,</hi> to poor man in <hi>Christ,</hi> and otherwise not the object of our <hi>trust,</hi> but of terror; yet is this way now come to that length, as it would seem to despise all <hi>moral releef.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. I must yet <hi>add</hi> here, tho it be a very sad ungrateful <hi>Subject,</hi> how we are faln in a <hi>day,</hi> when the greatest discoveries of <hi>God,</hi> both in the way of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> seems to have no affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting sense, or regard on this generation, and the great designs both of <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>providence</hi> amidst such marvelous changes hath gone before, in that manner withstood as most seemes to unite there strength herein; even when this may be in a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:205487:84"/>singular way applicable to <hi>our time,</hi> what the Lord did once speak to <hi>Israel</hi> by <hi>Moses; your eyes have seen the great Acts of the Lord,</hi> and these <hi>great temptations, the Signs,</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> which he hath done in this <hi>last age;</hi> yet if Soveraign grace do not marvelously appear, it may be fear'd, that both the <hi>voice of God</hi> in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> hath discharg'd their commission, without any due regard to the same; and that judgment, and mercy after such extraordinar methods of divine patience have done their part, and is now come to such a <hi>judicial</hi> withdrawing, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that <hi>great Ambassador,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of God from his Church,</hi> that there seems but small access to serious <hi>Publick Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>fasting,</hi> or to call for <hi>solemn Assemblies</hi> for this end, except to <hi>Personate,</hi> &amp; <hi>Act such a part</hi> as that of the <hi>mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Women amongst the Jews at Funerals,</hi> and amongst these of the most <hi>serious Spirit</hi> in this day, such a restraint may be found of that <hi>Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and fervor herein which once did appear, as renders it a more <hi>ominous Presage</hi> that there may be nothing to follow but that last sentence, <hi>let them alone;</hi> and must not all thus reason and judge, that as the interest of <hi>Sacred Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Honor,</hi> and <hi>Glory of God</hi> in mens subjecting thereto is of much higher value then any <hi>temporal Interest;</hi> so is the <hi>Vindication</hi> of the same before the World of a greater concern then the <hi>stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> or <hi>standing of Kingdoms,</hi> yea to fear more
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:205487:85"/>deeply that such a <hi>time,</hi> how long so ever defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, must at last take place, when his spotless procedure of <hi>Judgement,</hi> shall be then cleared fully; <hi>shall I not visit for these things, shall not my soul be avenged on such</hi> a People.</p>

               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:205487:85"/>nor is it questionable there was a serious part then who were deeply affected with such a time, tho it was not easy to find one of a <hi>truly raised spirit,</hi> to do and endure something more then ordinare for God, when so great a <hi>ruine</hi> was ready to fall under their hand; but to clear the <hi>import of such a call,</hi> with respect to the publick State of the <hi>Churches of Britain,</hi> under this <hi>allusion,</hi> here made use off, to stand in a <hi>gape and breach,</hi> when the <hi>Church as a defenced City</hi> is laid open to an extream and imminent hazard; I must speak a few things to be considered, what must follow if no <hi>Intercessor</hi> be found, to answer the voice of this <hi>call,</hi> by a suitable appearance herein.</p>

            <p>But tho it is clear that this voice and <hi>call</hi> for <hi>standing in the gape and breach,</hi> does respect all of a serious spirit in the things of God, yet are there some more eminently fitted from the Lord with peculiar Excellencies on their spirit then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to appear on so high a service; which as it is a talent not bequeathed in vain, where this in a more remarkable way is let forth, so is it of greatest weight to know <hi>time</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> for this end, and when a <hi>season of Providence</hi> may

They have a peculiar access also to such a service for God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the place they live in, who have more advantage then others by the Repute and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their <hi>Example,</hi> to walk in a <hi>countermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any publick</hi> and <hi>contagious evill of the time,</hi> as are most prevalent, and thus to affright the bold and daring countenance thereof; this should be a honourable appearance to oppose the <hi>Kingdom of Sathan,</hi> wherein it's getting most remarkable strength and credit by the Customariness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 5.

Yet is not the door for such a <hi>Service</hi> shut on any who have an interest in the <hi>Truth once delivered to the Saints,</hi> but may still have some share and room in so great an <hi>Undertaking for God,</hi> and the Interest of his Truth; and should each of a serious spirit, design something <hi>personally</hi> for answering this <hi>call,</hi> to sustain a part in so choile a service for the truth, suitable to their Station and Talent, it should bring a marvelous change there with on the times, and cause another face appear in the publick face of the Church; nor is it expressible what the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of a <hi>little strength,</hi> when it hath been designed for the <hi>Lord,</hi> &amp; under his call hath oft at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which in no ordinare way, or from any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible appearance could ever have been expected, yea what a marvelous use the soveraing God can make of a few nay of one, where his concurrence goes forth therewith.</p>
            <p>But since the publick State of things this day is such as seems, to controul any confidence or hope for answering such a <hi>call, to stand in the breach of so trying and hazardous a time,</hi> I would speak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

               </gap> few things in the <hi>third place,</hi> which may put some more then ordinare weight of this <hi>call</hi> on our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. 1. That as it's easy for the Lord to raise

            <p n="2">2. If it be a serious business to <hi>discern the times;</hi> we are in with respect to the <hi>publick State of these Nations,</hi> the voice of this <hi>call</hi> might then ly near our spirits, since if we <hi>turn our eyes back,</hi> it is demonstrably evident that the Lord hath not dealt so with any <hi>Nation of the Gentiles</hi> under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> as with the <hi>Isle of Britain,</hi> both as to eminent experiments of Providence, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of Grace and measures of light, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since it's recovery from the Power of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Darkness; so as it is not strange that he hath gone forth in a more singular way of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure therewith then other <hi>Churches,</hi> and tho <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is new under the Sun as Solomon</hi> speaks, yet there may be seen some thing peculiar and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing as to the way and Actings of Providence there in this age, as will not be easy for the most
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:205487:91"/>judicious <hi>Observers,</hi> to find a precedent for the same; and if we now consider the <hi>present time,</hi> as things are stated after such resolute oppositions to the voice of these <hi>times past,</hi> and when no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitudes of Providence hath yet put any stop to a growing hight of <hi>Apostacy,</hi> as may bee too visible there; yea that it's sure, God will not lose his Work or Intent in the great expence he hath been at for <hi>reclaiming this Generation,</hi> it may be then without a <hi>Prophetick Light</hi> seen that something very <hi>extraordinar is near,</hi> either in the way of <hi>Judgment</hi> or <hi>Mercy;</hi> so as this service and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the present <hi>Breach</hi> seems to be in another manner call'd for bejond that of an ordinare day, when there is yet room, and the door of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession not absolutely shut; but if this seem light, it will be found that the longest measure of <hi>divine Patience</hi> will come to a <hi>Year and a Day at last.</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

I know it's no easy thing to improve the <hi>Providences of times past,</hi> that are at any distance from us, or to bring them home by a just <hi>application</hi> to the <hi>present day,</hi> and to compare what we now see of the Way and Workings of God, with what hath already past in these <hi>late Years,</hi> but if this were more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and understood, there might be another view and discerning of the <hi>times we are in,</hi> and <hi>what of the night</hi> now it is: we have seen in some singular way, the rising and falling of humane interests so contrare to humane reason and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, as might tend fully to clear from what hand they came, and to what Issue they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; we have seen such <hi>Revolutions,</hi> which the <hi>Churches of Britain</hi> hath gone thorough, and hath past over the same, as seem yet little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, and it must be a perverse and false Judgment, if it be supposed that we have no more to do herewith, but anaked remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of such things in the matter of Fact, and what was mens way and part therein. But that I may come more near on this <hi>Subject,</hi> there are some things that need to be further understood thereon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it's sure when such a <hi>Gape</hi> this day is

As there can be no suspence, or darknes in this, so is it no less clear, his entring on the administration of his <hi>Mediatory Kingdom,</hi> was reserved only to the times of the <hi>N.

               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:205487:95"/>and <hi>Lord of all:</hi> for this is a truth that shines with so clear a light from the whole <hi>Scripture,</hi> as it may be strange how possibly it should be questioned, &amp; nothing can be more comforting to <hi>Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,</hi> then to have so highly desirable a <hi>hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their power,</hi> as they may have the <hi>Son of God,</hi> thus interessed in their <hi>security,</hi> and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> as a part of that <hi>inheritance,</hi> which belongs to his <hi>Meditatory Kingdom.</hi> Nor does it <hi>evacuate the Magistracy of Heathens</hi> for the interest of humane society, tho they have none in the <hi>Church;</hi> as it can never make void also his <hi>Catholick Right,</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> over them, by <hi>whom Kings reign, Prov.</hi> 8:15. although it restrains the exercise thereof.</p>

               <q rend="inline">to search the Scripture concerning the <hi>Messias,</hi> and the truth of the New Testament, where after seven dayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about the same, and not a few Arguments offered from their continued desolation and captivity since the time of Christ; some Popish Deputies at last were admit, who in stead of promoting the Christian Faith, pressed them to believe the Worship of the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> upon which that great Assembly broke up in a tumult, crying no Christ, no Images, no Woman God, and cast dust on their heads, upon so irrational a Blasphemy: It is true, some of the Rabbies then, did much desire Protestant Divines to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:205487:109"/>have met with them, but that the Pope and Emperor had joined to shut them wholly out, tho thousands of Strangers were then present at a meeting of so great expectation, of the Jews coming in to the Christian Faith;</q> but I mention it for this end, what a cry would that have made, if they had been told of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and dependent God, &amp; to subject themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves here to the greatest contradictions to Reason.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:205487:109"/>under; but on this <hi>Head,</hi> I shall speak to a few <hi>grounds,</hi> whereon this <hi>Tribute to the declarative Glory of God, from his great Works of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about his Church,</hi> will in another manner be rendred to him then heretofore.</p>
            <p n="1">I.

            <p n="2">II.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:205487:110"/>appearance in the same. It is one of the dismal signs of the present time, how much the spirits of men are at work to darken so far, as possible the most eminent <hi>Discoveries of God in his Works,</hi> and in the most extraordinare revolutions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, as if they would set bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to him, according to the course and order of second causes, and subject, both the truth of his <hi>Word</hi> and his <hi>Works</hi> to the comprehension of their <hi>reason,</hi> tho some civil respect, they will give, and the name of his being the <hi>prime cause,</hi> but shut their eyes on what is more extraordinar and solemne in any piece of his work. I would yet point at some <hi>special Heads,</hi> that belong to this choise part of <hi>Divinity,</hi> which we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, will in another manner be opened up, and I desire to rejoice in the hope hereof. 1. As to these more <hi>singular cases of Providence,</hi> which hath been in the Churches course, since her <hi>first translation</hi> from the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with the is sue and consequences thereof, contrare to the rules or principles of natural reason, which is ane Inquiry to be more fully improven, then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been attained this way; when men shall see the <hi>end of the Lord</hi> herein, with such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as shall tend to <hi>clear all bygones</hi> in his work. 2. These remarkable <hi>Periods</hi> of time, wherein the <hi>Prophetical Part of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> hath been successively brought forth in their proper <hi>Season,</hi> as was foretold, is yet to

There is a greater discovery yet to be made, then hath been hitherto, how the <hi>Church hath been led in a right way,</hi> and by a straight <hi>line</hi> in her whole course, through that <hi>long,</hi> and <hi>terrible Wilderness,</hi> which she was to pass, under the dispensation of the Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; and what eminent <hi>services</hi> the Saints have been put on in these strange measures of their <hi>warefare,</hi> which was then allotted to them, and in their <hi>overcoming work</hi> thereby; yea what a higher Triumph our <hi>blessed Redeemer</hi> hath had in the <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> of his People in so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal a time, then in any external flourishing state of his Church, so as it might be said it was then <hi>day,</hi> as to the <hi>presence of his spirit,</hi> and <hi>irresistable efficacy of his truth</hi> on his followers, when it seemed otherwise as the darknes of <hi>midnight.</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> There belongs to this part of <hi>Divinity,</hi> some higher breaking up of light, yet to be made on that Mystery of the <hi>Communion of the Saints here</hi> with other, in the <hi>way of providence,</hi> and what a joint interest they have herein, as to what hath been more singular in the Lords way, and disposal about others of his People: we have little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood what are inriching <hi>trade,</hi> we might drive
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:205487:111"/>upon that <hi>stock</hi> of these <hi>ancient experiments</hi> of Christians in following the Lord, and these emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent tryalls they have made of the truth, who hath in ages past gone before, and what a <hi>Pawn</hi> is thus put in our hand, for a further strengthning in the Faith; yea what publick interest thus the whole <hi>Church of Christ</hi> hath, in some eminent acts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence about particular Christians, which in the import and greatness thereof was not given for themself only, but as a publick concern to the whole <hi>Generation,</hi> that seek after God in their day, and for the times to come, according to that <hi>Psal.</hi> 10:3. <hi>Many shall see it and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.</hi> 5. I must <hi>add,</hi> one great improvement of this special <hi>Head of Divinity,</hi> which will yet be above the measures of times past, in the extent of that <hi>Reference,</hi> and <hi>Appeal,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness of God,</hi> for what he hath spoken and promised to his Church; and is that <hi>Tribute of praise,</hi> which in a higher degree is to be payed in to him, now when it's so near to the close of time, then by that great testimony of <hi>Joshua</hi> 25:14 how <hi>not one thing had fail'd of all the good things the Lord had then spoken in behalf of his Church, but had fully taken place,</hi> and was the same <hi>Appeal,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> made <hi>I. Kings</hi> 8.56. for this with a higher glory and evidence is to be the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the latter days, when it's drawing near to that magnificent close and period of <hi>Prophetick
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:205487:112"/>Chronology,</hi> and finishing of the Mystery of God therein; how his <hi>spotless truth</hi> hath as the <hi>Sun in his strength</hi> kept it's way and course amidst all these dark clouds, which hath spread to darken the same; and no <hi>promise</hi> or <hi>prediction</hi> of that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred record of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> hath ever fail'd or fallen to the ground, now when it's drawing so near to the <hi>perfect Day.</hi> It is true each <hi>age,</hi> hath had their proper <hi>measures of light,</hi> in order to the service of that time, and something peculiar al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted in the dispensations of <hi>Providence,</hi> yea some greater eminency did belong to these <hi>times past,</hi> when the sufferings of Christians did most abound, in the <hi>adventures of Faith,</hi> and in the <hi>tryal of love,</hi> then in after times, but as to higher discoveries of the <hi>works of God &amp; the depths of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> about his Church, these was reserved to that <hi>period,</hi> when the <hi>Mystery of God</hi> hereon should be more fully perfited, and in this respect it's to be said, <hi>blessed is he that waiteth, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,</hi> to such a solemn time, and to have his <hi>lot</hi> fall therein, as is spoken <hi>Dan.</hi> 12:12.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But for a further clearing of this <hi>Subject,</hi> since the <hi>Glory of the Kingdom of Christ</hi> is so near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd in the discovery and entertainment of his <hi>Works,</hi> in the day thereof, and now when a more eminent appearance thereof is near, that Kingdoms and Nations in their <hi>Complex Body,</hi> shall in a more solemn way be the <hi>Lords;</hi> It should be expected that the <hi>return</hi> and <hi>oblation of praise</hi>

               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:205487:113"/>which are yet to be brought forth as cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in an other way be expected. But on this <hi>Subject</hi> I would humbly offer some few reflections, which should be matter of a serious regard.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as its highly becoming, on some <hi>eminent piece of the Work of God,</hi> or publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, for a Nation or State to have <hi>solemn and publick returns of thankfulnes</hi> to him thereon; yet is it strange how so little regard should thus be to have the greatnes of any such mercy <hi>sought out,</hi> and the same <hi>publick care extended,</hi> for keeping up a <hi>venerable remembrance</hi> thereof, so that such a service of <hi>Gratitude</hi> be not bounded with the transient work of a day, since otherways it is a most <hi>essential want,</hi> and with holding a proper and important part of that <hi>Tribute,</hi> which is due into God herein, for there can be no sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table regard to serve the end of such <hi>Providences,</hi> and what was so straitly injoined of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> which was the <hi>Churches</hi> continued practice there; yea of the same <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>perpetual use</hi> in all after times, if it should not be still a <hi>publick trust</hi> under the furthest <hi>humane care</hi> to promote the same, tho <hi>divine Record and History</hi> for this intent does now cease.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But as this hath ane unquestionable <hi>tye on Churches,</hi> and a <hi>Christian State</hi> to design the most honourable respect, and entertainment of the <hi>great Acts of God</hi> in their day, and is made their <hi>propertalent</hi> to answer to; so does a just exonera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:205487:113"/>herein, call for the most <hi>exact scrutiny</hi> and <hi>search</hi> on the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> thereof, on which the weight, and credit of this <hi>service</hi> does so far depend, to cause a more <hi>full assent,</hi> by these who come after to such a testimony, that these rare Providences, wherein the Lord did thus make himself known, were not only in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time <hi>sought out,</hi> and enquired unto, under their <hi>proper circumstances,</hi> but by such of greatest weight, and advantage, for a work of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whose sincerity and judiciousness might be convincing, and the integrity of such ane <hi>Intent,</hi> cleared from any partial respect or end, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennerly for <hi>exalting the Majesty of God,</hi> and strengthning men in the <hi>Faith,</hi> by so great a <hi>seal to his Truth,</hi> and for the interest of the <hi>Posterity;</hi> yea wherein these who in some lesser differences did not fully meet in the same <hi>Judgment,</hi> yet might intirely unite, in such a <hi>service</hi> and <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> as this.</p>

It is true, there is no want of <hi>Histories,</hi> and the Church hath been blessed with that singular mercy of <hi>Martyrologies</hi> by faithful and impartial hands, to attest the power of divine grace, and supports of the spirit given to sufferers for the truth, and of late it was of great use the concurrence of <hi>Civil Authority</hi> to that <hi>Work of the History of the Church of England,</hi> that's now extant, by an <hi>excellent Writer;</hi> but for this intent, it is something distinct by its self, with respect only to these <hi>Monuments of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> relating to a <hi>particular Church,</hi> that are of <hi>publique, clear,</hi> and <hi>uncontrolled evidence,</hi> to have the <hi>remembrance</hi> thereof with the <hi>highest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> kept up, and secured from the prejudices and cavills of men thereat; yea to such <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadges</hi> in that day, whereon the <hi>Signature,</hi> and <hi>Impress</hi> of the more immediate appearance of <hi>God</hi> hath had most full and bright evidence; these great <hi>changes</hi> of a publique interest, which hath then occurred, wherein some extraordinar <hi>Conjunction</hi> in the course of Providence, might be seen, above <hi>natural causes,</hi> and the ordinare way of <hi>Gods Working,</hi> such interpositions of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>power,</hi> by which he hath designed to put some eminent <hi>honor, on acts of trust,</hi> and relyances on his truth, as might be <hi>exemplary to after times,</hi> and serve for that end, that they who come after, might <hi>sett their hope on God, and not forget his Works Psal.</hi> 78: 7. yea extraordinar <hi>Acts</hi> also of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:205487:114"/>
               <hi>divine Judgment,</hi> whereby he hath appeared in some unusual manner, to vindicate the honor of his <hi>Laws,</hi> against publick and notorious viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the same, which may be clearly seen were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ot designed for <hi>that age</hi> only, but as a <hi>publick uncern</hi> for after times.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Can it be questioned, that since that <hi>Sacred Canon of the Scripture is sealed,</hi> and <hi>consigned to the Church,</hi> to have no more addition thereto, but that it's now a part of the highest <hi>trust</hi> upon the <hi>Gentile Churches,</hi> to have a most venerable respect for conveyance of the <hi>great Works of God,</hi> from <hi>me Generation to another,</hi> &amp; to bear such <hi>evidence</hi> thereof, as the nature of these things is capable of, for a <hi>moral certainty;</hi> yea that this might be on such <hi>tryall,</hi> as should silence and convince the most inquisitive, and suspicious spirits of men herein, this is of a serious and weighty import, if it were considered: 1. How so high a <hi>concern of the Glory of God</hi> is thus intrusted to <hi>tradition by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane testimony and record,</hi> and to the credit thereof, as that way only which the Lord hath now fix'd for the convoyance of his marvelous works <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o after times, on which he once put that value as to give them a special room in <hi>Sacred Writ,</hi> and tho there is no such way now to attest the same, yet is not the weight of that service taken off the Church, which is mentioned <hi>Isay</hi> 62:6. to be the <hi>Lords Remembrancers and Recorders of his great Acts,</hi> as the <hi>Original</hi> there bears. 2. It
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:205487:115"/>is unquestionable that he hath reserved the greatest of his Works, wherein he will most eminently appear, to the <hi>last times,</hi> and what a loss hath it been to the Christian World unto this day, that unfaithful part which we must charge upon <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages,</hi> in no suitable regard to have such ane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> interest and treasure, with a <hi>publick care,</hi> secured for the posterity, through which the credit and honor of <hi>tradition</hi> hath been so much broke as hath rendred the use thereof of small effect. 3. And it's known how difficult a part it is to gain credit in this day, to the truth of what's more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinar in <hi>passages of providence,</hi> even where the relaters thereof hath as to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and conviction the most full assurance, and hath designed what Inquiry was suitable in such a case; whilst the want of a more unite and publique concurrence takes off so much of that weight, which it might have in after times; but I have confidence, that a higher service of this kind in the improvement of so great a <hi>Talent</hi> for the honor of God, does yet wait on the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; succeeding race, as shall tend to bring up what hath been detain'd of such a rent and tribute of praise, yea that these whose <hi>Lot</hi> shall be in the dayes that are now coming, and fall in with the growing state and glory of the Kingdom of Christ to see these things, which will exceed the thoughts and faith of this day herein, shall see and enjoy such <hi>Records</hi> of these times, where the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:205487:115"/>great intent shall be of that kind <hi>Revel.</hi> 15:3. <hi>Great and Marvelous are thy Works, Lord God Almighty, Just and True are thy Ways thou King of Saints,</hi> and where the credit of such a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony shall not be <hi>personal</hi> only, but <hi>national</hi> in a more solemn, unite concurrence herewith then hath been hitherto known.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is on this <hi>Subject,</hi> I must <hi>add</hi> further, that a <hi>traditional conveyance</hi> of more special and momentous things of Providence, might be of much use, were it suitably improven, to have a remembrance thereof continued in a <hi>Family Line</hi> and <hi>Relation,</hi> which is one peculiar way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>present Generation</hi> might declare the truth and faithfulness of God to the <hi>next.</hi> It is true, there is no serious Christian, but is thus sifted, and accountable on such a service to put to his <hi>seall,</hi> by some explicit personal testimony, that God is true, upon his tryall hereof, and most specially to improve that season, when it is near to the <hi>close and shutting up of time,</hi> that with his last and dying breath he might bear the same wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the truth of Christ, and to the advantage and excellency of his way and service, which he did in the whole course of his life past, and of that joy, complacence &amp; assurance of mind, which these have found, and now hath in the way of truth; but there is something more peculiar in this <hi>Testimony,</hi> to be understood, with respect to these to whom things in a more singular manner
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:205487:116"/>hath been allotted then to other Christians, in the way of Providence, and hath in the <hi>Record</hi> and <hi>Journal</hi> of their life had more extraordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Remarks</hi> and <hi>Confirmations</hi> from the Lord, as gives higher access to this service, and adds to the value of such a Testimony. I would offer but a few thoughts on such a <hi>Head,</hi> which may possibly seem a strange and dark thing to some: 1. It was once for a long time that the <hi>Series of the Church</hi> was kept up in a <hi>Family Line</hi> from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to the 12 <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and what a rare course and conduct of Providence was thus transmit to after times, which is so great ane interest, and treasure to this day, and tho that <hi>conveyance</hi> was by an infallible spirit, yet is this so far <hi>exemplary</hi> thereby, for such a confirmatory witness, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Christians, to the truth, when it comes to their <hi>last improvement of time,</hi> and of what hath been more signal and eminent in the Lords deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, that it should be one of the choisest <hi>Legacies</hi> they could be queath to their <hi>Relations,</hi> yea a singular mean to have Religion thus kept alive in a more venerable respect thereto in a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily State,</hi> and to fix stronger engagements to the way of God, on their <hi>surviving Friends.</hi> 2. I hope there be no serious discerning Christian, but hath some more <hi>select Observations of their life,</hi> and what hath been most remarkable in the course of Providence towards them, layd up, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of which might be of <hi>singular use,</hi> besides
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:205487:116"/>their own personal interest therein, to a further e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment of others in the way of truth; tho any improvement of that kind needs much <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian prudence and sobriety</hi> to qualify the same; yea, were this suitably designed in such dismal times, we are now fall'n in, what accuss might private Christians have, these specially who have gone through more extraordinar tryalls then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be thus a <hi>publique blessing</hi> to their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and how honourable a service were it for God, to advance the credit of Religion, and fix deeper impressions of the same on mens spirits, that these who have been admit to more <hi>special adventures of Faith,</hi> amidst the various conflicts of their day, should in the <hi>close</hi> thereof have this as their proper work to <hi>deliver the truth</hi> off their hand, which they had receaved, with their <hi>seal</hi> and <hi>testimony</hi> to the same, as that which they had proven and tryed in a more then ordinare way, and which had brought them safe and honourably through, as was the last Words and <hi>Witness of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. <hi>Who hath delivered my soul out of all distress:</hi> this I humbly judge falleth in as the last and peculiar service of a Christian, when it hath the advantage to be more valuable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to others, then in any other time of their life, &amp; were a thing highly desirable, that a <hi>work of this kind</hi> should be suitably prepared, to prevent a surprisal of death, &amp; going silent off the <hi>stage,</hi> which hath been the lott of these who have shin'd most
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:205487:117"/>brightly thereon; and as it surely hath the most opportune season in the <hi>last Scene of a Christians Work,</hi> so may it be yet more designed and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>last ages of time,</hi> when there is to be expected such <hi>Testimonies for God,</hi> and to the <hi>Glory of his Truth,</hi> as will much exceed the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar Standard</hi> of these times past, and we are now in. The full sense of that <hi>Scripture John</hi> 3:33. should have a great weight herein, <hi>he that hath received his Testimony, hath sett to his seall that God is true,</hi> where there is a peculiar <hi>debt,</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> on the one hand that is put on such, who hath the truth and testimony of God consign'd for tryall of the same; and a <hi>discharge</hi> thereof, which on the other hand they stand accountable for <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to their seall that God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <head>AN APPENDIX TO THE <hi>Foregoing Discourse,</hi> In both the PARTS thereof.</head>
            <p>THOUGH the intent of what was at first directed to the <hi>private use</hi> of some, now made <hi>publick,</hi> was with that design of brevity, and to keep off any enlargement, as it may seem rather an <hi>Index of things,</hi> than a <hi>Discoursing</hi> of the same; Yet, to prevent mistake, and for more clear understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what hath been principally design'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, both as to the <hi>Personal Establishment of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> in this State of their Trial and Warfare, and with respect of the <hi>Publick State of the Church;</hi> it hath oblig'd me to offer some addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional touch, in a <hi>short review</hi> on the same, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:205487:118"/>more specially on <hi>some truths,</hi> which I humbly judge, though of great import in the present time, yet have not been touch'd by others, so far as is known to me; Which I shall speak a little farther to in some distinct <hi>Sections.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>
                  <hi>SECT.</hi> I.</head>
               <p>IT might seem unsuitable, to set down the <hi>Contents,</hi> as is usual, of what is most specially handled in a directive way, in the <hi>First Part of this Discourse;</hi> where such a variety of things is there wrapt up, in so few words, on that Great Subject: but, since it's ordinary for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to pass their Judgment on the whole of any such Discourse, with a short glance at a part on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I shall offer, in the room thereof, some few <hi>Propositions</hi> drawn forth out of the same, as they lie closely together in a joint <hi>Series,</hi> and <hi>Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to give light, and assistance for so high an end, they are directed to; and, on things, which may be remote from the thoughts and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of most who are enter'd on that high di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing profession of the Christian Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. That the highest rational enjoyment of a Christian within time, does surely lie in such an assurance, and quiet of Mind on the <hi>Certainty of Divine Truth,</hi> as can Answer so great a Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made hereof to Men, and the greatness of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205487:118"/>that adventure they must shortly make thereof; nor can the <hi>Ultimate Inquiry</hi> about the <hi>event,</hi> and full enjoyment of our hope, to secure the heart herein, go farther, than to know there is a Divine Testimony, to warrant the same, and that we are in sure terms herewith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. There must either be an <hi>entire rest, and settlement of a Christian's Spirit</hi> on <hi>Divine Truth, or none at all,</hi> since there can be no possible fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt these; or relief, where the ground of it cannot fully support the Soul, though all visible refuges, or humane assistances should fail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. An <hi>implicit,</hi> and <hi>light assent to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith,</hi> and the great and astonishing things thereof, <hi>is a degree of Atheism, and indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy herein;</hi> nor can there be a just claim to so high a profession as this is from the residue of Men, until once it be a solemn, and proper bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness by it self, for Men to sist, and prove their own Soul, in the greatest recess, and composure upon their joyning in with the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> with inward consent, and no influence from external motives, of <hi>Example, Education,</hi> or <hi>humane Authority,</hi> herein, but pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on its own evidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop</hi> 4. That Humane State considered <hi>without God,</hi> and the Faith of the Excellencies of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, should tend onely to let Men see their Life to be a <hi>Curse,</hi> and <hi>Torment,</hi> rather than a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205487:119"/>blessing, if there were no <hi>Supernatural help,</hi> which is above themselves, against the Evils and Miseries of time, and of a future State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. Either a <hi>Christian,</hi> or of no <hi>Religion at all,</hi> is an unaswerable <hi>Dilemma;</hi> either the enjoyment of God, according to the Laws and Constitutions of the Christian Faith, or no possible comfort in the Light, and enjoyment of a <hi>Deity</hi> for Men, if they be Sinners; and so as a <hi>Deist,</hi> since Sin enter'd on the World, is a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to it self; when no such Sacred thing as Religion hath ever else had a being on the Earth, but that which might tend rather to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie Atheism, and to put the highest contumely and affront on the <hi>Divine Nature:</hi> Nor had the Jewish Religion another being but in the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and where it wants that, it hath none at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. As there is but one <hi>Sun</hi> that shines on this visible World; there hath onely been one <hi>Fountain,</hi> and <hi>Repository of Sacred Light</hi> given from God unto Men, both in order to their duty, and hope, without which <hi>Divine Record,</hi> Heaven and Earth should be shut up from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by any establisht rule of correspondence for the same; and the most excellent and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of Man, his Soul, have no directive, or comforting Light, both as to his present, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, or the way thereto, whilst this lower Earth hath a <hi>Sun</hi> to shine thereon.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. The First <hi>Entry of the Christian Faith,</hi> does Essentially lie in the Faith of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and of a <hi>Promised Redeemer;</hi> So as Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly be Christians, or enjoy the <hi>Gospel</hi> this day, if it were not on the certainty of that Blessed Record; and if this <hi>Great Promise,</hi> which was the first immediate object of the Churches Faith, and of that high value, as was worthy of their waiting, and expectation for 4000 years, had not been revealed, and made as sure as the performance now is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 8. As the time of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> was still a waiting, and expecting time, and the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation thereof a <hi>prelude</hi> to that great design of Grace which was to be brought forth; so was the <hi>Promise</hi> on which they waited, in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>absolute,</hi> and <hi>irrevocable,</hi> without depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon any condition in Man; and was the alone <hi>Original Right</hi> of all the Promises they did enjoy, which, in him, onely are Yea, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 9. Since the <hi>first precise time,</hi> and <hi>entry of the Christian Faith</hi> on the World, after the Fall, it hath yet never ceased to shine, and keep its course, or to be embraced by a peculiar People in a <hi>Church Relation,</hi> who were distinct, and separated from the residue of Men until this day; nor hath the <hi>Churches Head,</hi> in any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of time, ever wanted some part of his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> to converse with, as the peculiar objects of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:205487:120"/>his Love, and Delight; and, for imparting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self too, by vital influences of Light and Power; So that the uninterrupted <hi>Succession of a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Seed</hi> on the Earth until this day, since <hi>Abel,</hi> who, of Humane Race, first enter'd into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is no less, evident, and sure, than the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Mankind;</hi> and though some periods of time have had a larger extent of the Church therein, and some higher interest in the in-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the <hi>Elect;</hi> yet hath no <hi>Age</hi> ever wanted a proper share of that Glory, which the Lord would not restrict onely to some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 10. Were it supposable, that the <hi>Promised Messiah</hi> was yet to come, it were not possible to look for its accomplishment in another way, or under other circumstances than what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded hereof in the Gospel, or that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi> according to the tenor of the <hi>Old Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi> should <hi>act another part,</hi> than what he did; nor is there nay variation betwixt the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Creed</hi> of the Church then, and that which is ours now under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as to the Substance thereof, but that the one was founded on the <hi>Credit of the Promise,</hi> and the other on its full assurance of its <hi>accomplishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 11. There is yet this <hi>Essential change</hi> now in the Christian Faith, that what <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> were saved by, cannot <hi>save us;</hi> but would be absolutely <hi>mortal</hi> to rest on the Promise of a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:205487:120"/>Redeemer; or to believe, in general Terms, that he is come; but that this is he, whom <hi>the Father sealed,</hi> and sent into the World; and he alone, who, in the days of <hi>Tibertus,</hi> and under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> suffered at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 12. The <hi>precise time of the Sufferings and Resurrection of our blessed Redeemer,</hi> was that great and solemn <hi>Epocha,</hi> to begin a new Week, whereon the Churches entry on the <hi>highest glory of time,</hi> and on a <hi>new State,</hi> is to be dated; where the solemn observation of the <hi>first day of the Week,</hi> the <hi>Lord's day,</hi> had both its <hi>rise</hi> and <hi>right;</hi> the <hi>exact time whereof</hi> was so publick and famous, and of that high concern to the Primitive Church on this first entry unto a New World, as render'd it impossible to be in the least doubtfulness herein, or to have possibly fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on another day, besides the clear Sanction of <hi>Divine Authority</hi> for the same; but the less seems to be of a peremptory, and <hi>positive Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> made use of for this end, should be the greater excitement to our observation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, since the Lord would have it inforced most from <hi>internal Motives,</hi> and herein both <hi>try,</hi> and <hi>trust the Love of his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 13. It was reserved to the <hi>Gospel State of the Church</hi> to be the <hi>Theatre of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est wonders both of Providence and Grace,</hi> above all that ever had been known to the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and was then in a singular way allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:205487:121"/>to the first entry of that glotious Scene after the <hi>Ascension of Christ,</hi> which was to be acted under the New Testament, to have the <hi>God of this World</hi> put off his Visible Throne, and the whole <hi>frame of Paganism rased and extinct;</hi> to have so wonderful a change made on the whole face of the Earth, in the Planting, and Propagating of the Christian Faith; and in the most Savage parts thereof, by the <hi>alone Evidence and Vertue of sacred Truth,</hi> where no Humane Power could boast that their Arm, or Sword did bring this about; yea that the <hi>visible extent</hi> of the Christian Church within sixty years after the Ascension of the Lord, could exceed what it is this day.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:205487:128"/>Yea, which must also take in the <hi>times of divine patience,</hi> in waiting so long on the whole <hi>Gentile Church,</hi> with that measure of their <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and sufferings,</hi> which was to be filled up by them under such a dispensation of Grace; and it's a sad <hi>comment</hi> that serves to make a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truth dark, where the Great Teacher hath made it to the farthest obvious and plain.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:205487:129"/>that the full stroke on the <hi>Seat of Antichrist by the fifth Vial,</hi> is so evidently reserved to the <hi>final expiration of these set times of the Gentiles,</hi> and to that eminent displaying of the <hi>glory of Christ's Reign,</hi> which will then take place in that great and magnificent <hi>work of Judgment;</hi> for I must fix it in such a <hi>period, where the Spirit of God does expresly fix the same,</hi> 2 Thes. 2. to be by the <hi>brightness of Christ's second coming,</hi> which so clearly falleth in with that <hi>blessed, and bright Sun-shine of the State of the Gospel</hi> Church before the end, and is that great event of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which immediately pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="4">4. Tho the event will clear how far the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute of <hi>these times,</hi> and of the <hi>fulness of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Church is now accomplished,</hi> yet so far as <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:205487:129"/>Signs</hi> does give light and evidence herein, it may, with a suitable sobriety, be judged, that the <hi>close hereof</hi> is drawing very near, when we see what length the <hi>course of the Gospel</hi> hath come, according to what is so expresly <hi>foretold by Christ, through the whole World;</hi> when these <hi>times</hi> which <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> once had are furnsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the <hi>Sun also in its gradual course,</hi> as to this blessed light, hath staid so long in the <hi>west,</hi> and so visibly now <hi>declining</hi> there, as to the whole <hi>Western Churches,</hi> I hope towards a near, and bright rising once again in the <hi>East;</hi> yea, when the intent of Providence, in these late dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently directed for this end, that these times of the Gentiles, now in a separate state, may have a more full perfecting: when we see also such a <hi>signal declining of the Ottoman Empire,</hi> it may be as a <hi>Promissory sign</hi> for this end, and have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory respect to that <hi>last exit,</hi> and expiring thereof, which is to be a matter of our Faith under the 6th <hi>Vial;</hi> and if the expresing thereof suitable to the <hi>Apocalyptick Stile,</hi> seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But there is <hi>one Sign</hi> of another nature, which may have a very sad aspect on the present time, when we see to what a height the <hi>Apostasie of the Gentile Church</hi> in the most reformed state thereof this day is now come, with so visible a growing <hi>Eclipse,</hi> which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:205487:130"/>I judge may be too justly feared go not off, until once these <hi>times be fulfilled,</hi> and the dawning of that long expected, and assuredly promised day of the <hi>Churches last restauration,</hi> break up, as the first solemn entry on the Glory of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Millennium,</hi> in that sence the Scripture does warrant our hope hereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As this great <hi>revolution</hi> will be the most signal, and eminent <hi>period of time,</hi> which is yet to take place in <hi>Prophetick Chronology;</hi> So must I humbly judge, that such a <hi>reiterated testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Holy Ghost,</hi> to the perfecting of the <hi>times,</hi> and <hi>fulness of the Gentiles,</hi> as an entry on a new state of things is most expresly <hi>set up as a publick mark and standart,</hi> for giving light to the <hi>Churches course</hi> in the future times there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whereby a safe and clear judgement may be attained both in the <hi>application of Prophesies,</hi> and as to the <hi>great designs of Providence</hi> now in the <hi>last days;</hi> &amp; is it not made clear by express testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Scripture herein, that we are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that <hi>day of Restauration to the Jewish race,</hi> or the taking off the <hi>vail of judicial blindness</hi> of their minds, until once this great <hi>event</hi> take place, but accordingly we are to have our faith directed; nor are to expect such a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the <hi>glory of Christ,</hi> until then, upon that <hi>highest period of his reign</hi> here on the earth, in such a manner, as we are warranted to believe the same. But, it may be too justly feared, that before these <hi>times be fulfilled, the harvest of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:205487:130"/>earth,</hi> which seems in some unusual manner now <hi>ripe</hi> for the <hi>Sickle,</hi> is yet farther to be <hi>reaped,</hi> and some extraordinary work of judgment to have an accomplishment, which may be more strange and astonishing than what hath been known for some Ages past.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whatever <hi>distinct interest the Jewish race</hi> hath hitherto had in the World, yet is it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the <hi>Covenant of peculiarity,</hi> which once was with that People, is now <hi>void,</hi> and <hi>disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled,</hi> as to any more divided state, or standing by themselves, but what will then be resolved into a <hi>blessed coalition</hi> with the Gentiles, into one <hi>united state,</hi> wherein <hi>the Lord shall be one,</hi> and <hi>his Name one</hi> in the whole Earth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I know it is doubtful to some, that so great an <hi>event of Providence</hi> is yet to take place, of the <hi>Jews return again to the Lord</hi> in so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous a manner: But can such from any <hi>Church Records</hi> find, that since their <hi>rejection,</hi> and amidst these solemn times which have gone over the <hi>Gentile Church,</hi> of the success of the Gospel, any such noted and <hi>remarkable time of their Conversion</hi> hath occurred, as might, in the least, answer these unquestionable assurances gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Scripture hereof? but that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>induration of this People, and vail over their mind,</hi> hath been one of the most signal strokes of Divine Judgment, which was ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on Men; Or hath any times yet taken place of that <hi>promised effusion of the Spirit of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelick
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:205487:131"/>Repentance</hi> upon them, with a look upon him whom they had pierced, and so great a mourning as must once be with some suitable proportion to their <hi>Apostasie;</hi> which is assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take place under the times of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> else not at all; and be such a high spring-tide, as shall be the most near, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>preparatory work,</hi> to their <hi>restoration to a Church-State;</hi> and being taken in again to the embracements of his love and respect, whom they so despitefully opposed; yea it's with the flowing of that tide I doubt not, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall then have a <hi>new reviving,</hi> when this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed time is once come, and a proper interest here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as shall be a joint entry on a <hi>new world</hi> to both.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is true, if we look upon the present times, it may <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>stagger our Faith,</hi> as to so great and wonderful a thing, when <hi>so little in a preparatory way</hi> from all appearances is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising hereof; when on the one hand, the sense of this on Mens Spirits seems so rare, <hi>that the World is now governed by God,</hi> and could not <hi>subsist</hi> one moment by Humane Counsel, or Power, <hi>if he were not a God to it;</hi> and on the other hand, so extraordinary a time <hi>of oppositions to the growing Interest of Christ's Kingdom,</hi> which he hath received of <hi>the Father</hi> by the <hi>Covenant of Mediation,</hi> and is now near to the <hi>highest period of its visible glory;</hi> but it hath been clear, and oft strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205487:131"/>to my Faith, to <hi>reflect on these remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gradations which the visible Kingdom of our Lord Jesus hath had since his Ascension</hi> here on the Earth, both in its <hi>triumph over the Pagan World,</hi> and in these late times over the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian VVorld;</hi> and to see thus, how <hi>dark and dismal a state of things still did immediately precede the most bright display of his regal power, and the glory thereof,</hi> and how <hi>Satan's being let loose, by a penal permission,</hi> did appear most then, when <hi>his time was short;</hi> it's sure it would have seemed as incredible to hope, before the <hi>year</hi> 1517; for so great and wonderful a <hi>revolution,</hi> as after followed in the Churches case, as to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit what yet is to be brought forth in the World, and what a <hi>day</hi> is to shine when this darkness is over.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It should indeed, be matter of fear to stretch a confidence on the <hi>future state of the Church,</hi> where it's warrant is not clear, and will be no comforting <hi>light which Men kindle to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> though they should <hi>walk in the sparks thereof</hi> for a time; but it's on this <hi>great head of truth</hi> the Spirit of God does speak so expresly in this <hi>sense,</hi> as it cannot possibly bear another; how the <hi>times of the Gentiles are to be fulfilled,</hi> and in what respects. 1. That here will be no <hi>Unchurching,</hi> or rejecting of them, no more than it will prejudge the <hi>National Interest of Kingdoms and Nations, by becoming the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of our Lord Jesus,</hi> which shall redound
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:205487:132"/>then to their highest glory, and temporal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; but that when these limited <hi>times</hi> are once finished, there shall be no more a <hi>Gentile Church by it self</hi> on the Earth, but the <hi>Constitution of Christ's universal Kingdom</hi> shall be then such, as there will be neither <hi>Jew,</hi> nor <hi>Greek, Barbarian,</hi> nor <hi>Scythian,</hi> and neither <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> or <hi>Uncircumcision</hi> any more known; and no National emulation, or envy, to interfear with that great design of Grace. 2. It is a shutting up of these <hi>times</hi> as will be then the <hi>Churches entry</hi> on a <hi>new date, and computation of time,</hi> as to the course of Providence therewith, which is to begin with that <hi>last,</hi> and <hi>great Epocha,</hi> in the re-entrance on <hi>a new state;</hi> thus did <hi>Israel's coming out of Egypt,</hi> give a <hi>new date of time</hi> unto them. 3. It is then also will be the <hi>close</hi> and <hi>shutting up of that blessed administration of Providence,</hi> and designs thereof, with respect to the <hi>separate state of the Gentiles,</hi> though no <hi>final divorce,</hi> but to make way for their return, and <hi>recovery of their first love, the love of their espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,</hi> by a new betroathment of them to himself; and such a <hi>casting down</hi> only as will then raise <hi>them up farther</hi> with a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>joint interest</hi> in that rare frame of his <hi>Universal Kingdom.</hi> 4. But it's surely to the <hi>VVestern reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> that these <hi>last times of the Gentiles, and their fulfilling, hath a peculiar respect;</hi> who have not only had so long a day now given them, but their <hi>times renowed by a second restauration,</hi> which hath
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205487:132"/>not been the priviledge of the <hi>Eastern Churches;</hi> and now <hi>as this season is hastning away,</hi> so is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in a quick and swift motion</hi> this day, the more near it is to the <hi>close,</hi> wherein both goodness and severity from the Lord will eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; that as in the one respect he will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bear with the <hi>Gentile Church,</hi> when the measure of their <hi>sin</hi> (which is now at such a height) is once <hi>filled up,</hi> nor restrict the glory of the Gospel light thereto, which for this 1500 <hi>years</hi> hath been the <hi>proper sphere</hi> where it hath shined, yet will even then give them <hi>new and higher priviledges,</hi> when there shall be no dividing distances, more or separations in the whole <hi>Church of Christ.</hi> But O what a subject of admiration and joy may these times be, that have gone over the <hi>Gentile Church!</hi> What <hi>triumphs</hi> hath our <hi>blessed head</hi> had there, in the power of his own Grace, since their first espousals, in the issue of these extraordinary <hi>trials</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi> allotted thereto? What innumerable testimonies hath he had from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of his being infinitely dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to them than their <hi>Lives,</hi> and what <hi>endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of love</hi> have passed betwixt their God and them; of whom also is the greatest interest of the <hi>Church Triumphant</hi> now made up, and I hope <hi>the close of their times</hi> is yet to make an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>accession</hi> there to, and will be filled up yet more with special fruits and services of <hi>Love</hi> to him.</p>

               <p>I Have desired to abstract in the foregoing Discourse from entering on that so much controverted head of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> farther than to prevent mistake, as to what it relates to there, and is held forth, as to the great design of Providence which is now on foot about the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> and that <hi>higher Glory</hi> and <hi>Splendor</hi> it will yet have on the Earth; it hath been with astonishment, that I have oft thought on these strange and different senses, which are on this <hi>Prophetick Truth,</hi> when there is so much from the Scripture to be expository, and give light herein, but wherein I differ from such as are of eminent note and learning in this matter, is with a true honour and respect other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; onely I shall offer some few thoughts thereon to the judgment and <hi>trial</hi> of such for the Truths sake.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the <hi>personal return and reign of Christ</hi> in his Humane Nature upon this Earth, can possibly be now expected, whom the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens must contain, until the times of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of all things,</hi> and that the <hi>whole administration of Providence</hi> about the Church Militant be accomplished, and the mystery of God herein finished, when there will be no more
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205487:133"/>use of <hi>time;</hi> but, it's sure, this <hi>promised Millenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> must have its proper room in the course of Providence, onely within <hi>time,</hi> whilst the Church is yet Militant, on the Earth, and the last <hi>battle</hi> thereof to follow the same.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or, is it supposable, that our <hi>blessed Lord</hi> should be the continued <hi>object of Humane Sense,</hi> for a time, on this Earth, in the <hi>Glory, and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour</hi> of a <hi>visible appearance,</hi> which this State of Mortality we are in could not possibly admit; except Men would infer his coming under a vail, and to act some part of his <hi>humiliation</hi> herein; or otherwise, that the <hi>Earth</hi> be turned unto <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Appearance of <hi>our Redeemer in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> after his <hi>Ascension</hi> in <hi>the Union of the two Natures,</hi> brought such an additional Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the <hi>Church Triumphant,</hi> Can it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly judged, that the <hi>Glorious Tabernacle of his Humane Nature, in which the Godhead dwells Bodily,</hi> and admits of no <hi>ubiquity,</hi> should be withdrawn thence to this lower Earth for so long a time, who is <hi>set down at the right hand of his Father, to reign,</hi> and exerce his Office, as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> there, until the <hi>Elect</hi> be wholly gathered in, and all <hi>his Enemies subdued?</hi> yea, could such a discovery of his <hi>visible appearance</hi> to the World, which exceeds all the <hi>Miracles</hi> whatever were, since the beginning of time, be compatible with an <hi>immediate opposition to his Reign,</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:205487:134"/>by the Nations, upon <hi>Satan's being let loose,</hi> after the expiring of this <hi>Millennium;</hi> and to suppose a <hi>Second Ascension of Christ unto Heaven,</hi> from his Church here, which must be unavoidably inferred from his <hi>visible Personal Reign</hi> for such a limited time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But on the other hand, as to the <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Lord Jesus in the Glory and Splendor of his Kingdom,</hi> without any visibility <hi>in his Humane Nature,</hi> which is yet to take place; I do, with full assurance, believe, it shall unexpressibly exceed all, which hath ever been known, since his <hi>Ascension;</hi> to which <hi>period</hi> he hath reserved the highest degrees of <hi>effusion of his Spirit</hi> to his Church, and of the <hi>intimacy of Communion with himself</hi> unto Men; as also more full measures and <hi>discoveries of light</hi> on his revealed truth, than what hath been attained formerly; but of no <hi>new light,</hi> which doth not accord with the same; yea, that one of the greatest <hi>Harvests of the return of Prayer, after a Seed-time of many ages past</hi> will be then <hi>reaped,</hi> with a more near Intercourse and Trade with Heaven; nor is it to be questioned, that some extraordinary <hi>dispensation of Miracles,</hi> and immediate appearance of <hi>our blessed head,</hi> in the glory of his power, this way, will wait on such a revolution of time, with that tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous sence, and awe of his <hi>Divine Majesty</hi> on the Conscience of his greatest adversaries, as to cause them <hi>feign subjection,</hi> and bow down before
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:205487:134"/>him; but, Oh that such a time were more sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably prepared for, and the Subject of Prayer for its coming, than of Contendings, and Disputes about the same.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though the fixing of this <hi>great period,</hi> be convincingly manifest, <hi>under the sound of the last Trumpet,</hi> yet is it not to be judged, that it will be all alongst at the same <hi>height,</hi> but to have <hi>some gradual advance,</hi> from the <hi>first entry</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor that such a <hi>definite time of a thousand years</hi> is to be otherwise judged, than of some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>duration of time,</hi> as to this blessed Reign, when in the <hi>value, and splendour thereof,</hi> the light, and brightness of <hi>one day then, shall be as seven days in one;</hi> and the glory of <hi>one year</hi> such, as shall ballance with that of <hi>a thousand years before,</hi> and is to be reckoned in this sense, according to his computation, <hi>with whom one day is as a thousand years.</hi>

In such <hi>measures, and increase of light,</hi> as it could not be strange, that the Lord should take some higher proofs, and trials of the same, from his Church therein, than of <hi>other Churches</hi> answerable to such a Talent. 3. These <hi>out-lettings, and effusions of the Spirit of God,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:205487:135"/>which have been there so discernable, though we see the <hi>Ebb</hi> now, to be as <hi>low,</hi> in the life, and power of Religion, as once this <hi>Tide</hi> was conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous. 4.

               <p>IT is also unquestionable, that now in this <hi>last Age,</hi> the Lord's dealing with the <hi>Publick State of Britain, and Ireland,</hi> hath been yet in a more singular way, than in any times past, or with other of the <hi>Reformed Churches;</hi> as may cause great thoughts of heart, to consider, what <hi>manner of time</hi> our Lot hath been cast in; but since a naked remembrance of such an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary series of changes,</hi> as have of late gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Generation, or what was Mens part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, does little tend <hi>to see, and admire God,</hi> with most, who consider the same, or <hi>to discern wisely his work</hi> in such singular Providences; though this be of a higher concern than the <hi>rise, or fall of Monarchies,</hi> or the shakings of <hi>Publick Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in the <hi>civil interest of a Nation, if Mens great business in the Earth lies with God, more than with Men:</hi> I shall therefore speak to some things to which a <hi>serious reflex work on these late times,</hi> does most specially relate, and are more largely touched in the <hi>preceding Discourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It should be of great advantage to discern, and understand in such a manner these <hi>times past,</hi> as to see an <hi>immediate Divine,</hi> and <hi>supernatural causality</hi> in such amazing <hi>successive changes,</hi> that, might inforce Mens Souls to <hi>bow down, with a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:205487:136"/>reverent, and tremenduous sence of the Majesty of God herein,</hi> yea, keep this from ever being a <hi>subject of ordinary thoughts</hi> in reflecting on the same.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To see what an <hi>unusual variation,</hi> hath been in the ways, and methods of Providence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>publick State of Britain,</hi> in this <hi>Age,</hi> from the way and procedure of the Lord in times past, and <hi>former Precedents;</hi> and though much be in the dark, this day, as to <hi>his voice, and intent,</hi> for answering the ends hereof; yet such as are of a discerning Spirit, may have another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>Work, and Counsel of God,</hi> when it's brought in a more <hi>full, and entire Frame</hi> before us, than any present actors then on <hi>the Stage,</hi> whilst things were in their first <hi>mould:</hi> tho it is no easie thing in such a <hi>reflex work,</hi> to improve those extraordinary Providences past, by a just, and suitable <hi>application thereof</hi> to the <hi>present day,</hi> so as to see how <hi>each step</hi> herein in its <hi>successive place and room,</hi> hath still tended, <hi>to give light to another,</hi> and for a more full <hi>discerning of the work of God in these times,</hi> and <hi>what of the night it is now,</hi> as to the <hi>State of the Church.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:205487:137"/>effects;</hi> and in what manner the greatest depths of Humane Policy, and confidence, when they seem'd most secure from any hazard upon <hi>earth;</hi> have been derided from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>men poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd in their own cup;</hi> and what a rare <hi>reflex work</hi> should this be, to see, in what an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way the Providences of these times past have been directed to <hi>Seal Instruction on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Princes, and Great Men,</hi> and let them know in how small a time, the great God can pour contempt on such, and cause <hi>Princes to walk on Foot, when Servants did ride on horseback;</hi> but, it is no less matter of sad <hi>reflection,</hi> and may be to this day, what <hi>returns</hi> these <hi>Methods,</hi> which God has taken in a <hi>monitory way,</hi> have had from most, by forgetting the <hi>Storm</hi> they were once in, when they have got to the <hi>Haven,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them selves to another <hi>Stength, than that, which raised them.</hi>

               <p>IT may be indeed easier to <hi>translate</hi> our thoughts to things past, and judge thereof, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>Humane Interests and Designs,</hi> than it is to consider <hi>the way and conduct of Providence,</hi> and what a clear light, the <hi>succession of such amazing wonders,</hi> as have been in the <hi>Age past,</hi> brings herewith to this <hi>period of time</hi> we are now in.

               <p n="2">2. It's a <hi>reference</hi> of a serious concern I must make farther about the present time, If <hi>any particular Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:205487:139"/>that immutable constitution of his own Word <hi>will bear, the Lord is with you, whilst you are with him; but if you forsake him, he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake you?</hi> 2 Chron. 15.3. It hath been on some sad thoughts hereon, that I must leave this to the enquiry of others, who understand more of the times, how the <hi>State and Security of these Nations now stands in this respect,</hi> whether alone by an extraordinary forbearance of God, or in a <hi>Promissory way;</hi> and if <hi>the Scripture</hi> be given no less absolutely <hi>to secure the Protestant Reformed Church by Promise,</hi> than to be the <hi>alone Rule of their Faith,</hi> without which no Humane Power, or Confederacy can avail; for if that <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive testimony, and assurance which the God of Truth hath given,</hi> Jerem. 18.7. be irrevocable, and the unchangeable rule of his Procedure with Men, we then are not left to grope in the dark, as to our confidence, or fear this day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I must make a <hi>reference</hi> also, upon what is more fully spoke to on that <hi>Subject;</hi> which is not to any <hi>divided party,</hi> but to all such who in this day take <hi>the Times to heart,</hi> and have some <hi>raised thoughts, and desires to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ, and of his Reign</hi> here in the World: <hi>If such a Nation can be saved,</hi> or have any true confidence towards God for <hi>Success,</hi> where the <hi>Dominion and Power of Antichrist is fallen, and broke,</hi> by an <hi>eminent appearance of God</hi> herein, and yet the <hi>Kingdom of Christ is not set up in the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:205487:139"/>room hereof,</hi> by a new <hi>Surrender</hi> and <hi>Subjecting of themselves to his Ordinances, and Laws;</hi> but that some signal <hi>stroak of Divine Wrath, and Judgment,</hi> will inevitably follow thereon; Since, 1. There can be no higher affront-offered to our <hi>blessed Head,</hi> than a turning thus the purest Profession of his truth in the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> to serve a <hi>Secular interest, and design,</hi> which is given for eternal ends, and to divide the same from its great <hi>intent,</hi> which is, that <hi>such a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and People should be the Lord's,</hi> and come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his <hi>Dominion and Reign: A Negative Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> is a strange and dreadful <hi>Paradox,</hi> which <hi>is no Antichrist,</hi> as to the <hi>Papal Power;</hi> and yet <hi>no Christ,</hi> as to his blessed <hi>Preheminence,</hi> and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them; who, at once, can <hi>bear Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Protestant Interest,</hi> and the highest <hi>Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Protestant Religion;</hi> yet is this day now such, as it may be more easie to find a 1000 <hi>Protestants,</hi> than one such <hi>Lover of Christ,</hi> whose Soul, under the Power, and Attractions of his Love, is entirely joined to him. 2. This makes it the more formidable, that the time and season, which was 1500 <hi>years past foretold, is now come, for Christ's taking to himself his great power to Reign;</hi> So that we cannot be in the dark here, except Men shut their eyes on his going <hi>forth by such an extraordinary Administration of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, by the Sword, and Shakings of these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> now in these 50 <hi>years</hi> past, to assert the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:205487:140"/>of his Regal Power over the same, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his declared testimony, by his Word, and the taking place hereof, in the event of what was foretold, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.15. does meet with such clear evidence, as without a Judicial Stroak on Mens Judgments, cannot possibly be hid. 3. <hi>Tho the Nations be still angry,</hi> and their enmity, and opposition to the interest of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom</hi> is the more visibly raised, the <hi>nearer approaches</hi> that his Work and design herein make, yet will it not avail or serve for another end, but assuredly to make way for his <hi>wrath and to rule them by a rod of Iron,</hi> until his end be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, and that <hi>Princes and Great Men give their Power,</hi> with a full consent, <hi>to advance the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> yea, if it be a dark Riddle to Many, what these remarkable <hi>oppositions,</hi> which have been in <hi>Britain in this Age,</hi> to any <hi>Civil Settlements</hi> there, should mean, there will, I doubt not, be a more full discovery by <hi>Providence</hi> made hereof, to clear, that no Humane <hi>Counsel</hi> or <hi>Force,</hi> shall ever <hi>Settle these Nations,</hi> with any true fixedness, until this great design be joined in with; and that now is the time come, that <hi>Nations must surely stand or fall</hi> in their Temporal Interest, as they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the <hi>Intent,</hi> and Counsel of the Lord here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This may be matter of farther <hi>enquiry</hi> likewise, what access is now in so <hi>judicial a period of time,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:205487:140"/>to stand before the Lord in the gap, and breach, for turning away his wrath;</hi> if thus Grace may yet interpose, when judgement is ready to break forth, as to these <hi>Nations,</hi> and the <hi>Axe laid to the root of the Tree;</hi> yea, in what respect <hi>such a call</hi> for the same, as is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30. may be applicable to this day. This is a <hi>Subject</hi> I have at some length before spoken to, onely as to its clear, and express application to the present time, and state of these Churches; I would <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a few things</hi> farther to be considered by such, who are at more advantage to be <hi>seers, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerners</hi> of so <hi>extraordinary a time.</hi> 1. If such a <hi>Call</hi> as was then given to <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was not a <hi>publick precedent of the way, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendence of Grace,</hi> even when wrath was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth to the uttermost, and as the <hi>last call,</hi> ere the treaty was shut up, for <hi>after times of the Church,</hi> did thus come to the lowest terms, and in such a manner speak from the Lord; <q rend="inline">Is there not now one, to appear, and stand in so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent a hazard, with such a true <hi>National Love,</hi> as to lay their most endeared private interest at the stake to save the same, and stand for God herein, though they should stand alone, which should be as rare, and desirable a <hi>Society,</hi> to have a room in, as is upon the Earth; and to find such an <hi>erection</hi> thereon, by an excitement from Heaven, of <hi>Adventurers for God,</hi> and the publick Interest of his Church, to <hi>appear
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:205487:141"/>in the breach;</hi> when 'tis as a defenced City, laid open to so extream, and imminent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</q> 2. Though <hi>extraordinary excitements</hi> to a service of this kind, as we find on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Record, are rarely found in the Earth, yet it's sure, <hi>the duty of Moral excitation, and up-stirring</hi> in such a case, ceaseth not, which might make way for a more <hi>immediate gale of Divine influence and power and to open such a door for some restoring work in these Nations,</hi> as should make way for it self over all <hi>Mountains,</hi> and what at other times might seem insuperable. 3. If the astonishing <hi>signs of Wrath and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which are so discernable now, be truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, it may be too evident, that something <hi>very extraordinary</hi> beyond what we have seen, is assuredly <hi>near, either as to Judgment, or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> and how things are hastening, in an unusual manner, to a <hi>fatal period,</hi> if <hi>Grace</hi> do not yet farther interpose, to <hi>raise the Spirits of some</hi> with such a <hi>divine heroick Motion,</hi> as the Service of so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a time may need, and to a <hi>higher Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluteness in duty</hi> by visible <hi>Oppositions:</hi> But, Oh how hard is it to move, or act, in such a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when it's at the <hi>lowest ebb of the Tide,</hi> and the first cure to the <hi>intestine conflicts,</hi> and <hi>distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> of this day, which are boiled up to such a height, is like to be some unusual <hi>stroak of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Judgment,</hi> which may work at last, when all ordinary means for this end seem ineffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual?</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:205487:141"/>
               <p n="5">5. And should not the <hi>voice of such a Call,</hi> for appearing in so great and hazardous a <hi>breach</hi> on the Churches Interest, be matter of serious thoughts, when it hath a <hi>limited time and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> for the same, which may be quickly lost, but never regained again; and comes so discernably on such an intent. 1. To speak to this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration after such extraordinary <hi>warnings past,</hi> and a <hi>new day</hi> yet more given, that it is to <hi>prove them</hi> yet once again, <hi>before the decree go forth,</hi> and that <hi>he who waits to be gracious,</hi> and holds the ballance in his own hand, does wait for such an <hi>application</hi> unto him, as might yet tend to <hi>a respiting of wrath and Judgment,</hi> when it's ready to break forth; in which respect, <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Warnings</hi> of some great stroak on a People, may be true, and warranted, though they take no place in the <hi>event,</hi> when, according to that, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 18.7. the interposing of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>Repentance</hi> may sist its execution for a time▪ 2. To let Men know, that every <hi>day, and hour of such a limited season,</hi> when it's come to the <hi>last period of divine patience,</hi> is more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valuable and momentous for improvement of the same, than many years may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and a making light hereof, more highly provoking to the Majesty of God, and adds more to the Roll of such a Peoples Indictment, than what hath been formerly. 3. But how near the <hi>Final expiration of such a Call,</hi> yet with an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:205487:142"/>of Grace is reserved onely to him, to whom the <hi>Issues of Death belong;</hi> and though there be an infallible conduct, by Scripture-light, and the <hi>general rule of God's ordinary dispensations</hi> with Men, to discern the <hi>approaches of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> on a People, and the sad <hi>effects</hi> thereof in <hi>their proper causes;</hi> yea, how <hi>night is coming on,</hi> when <hi>the long shadows of the Evening are stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out,</hi> yet are the <hi>set measures of his forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> one of the depths of his way, which Men cannot sound, or comprehend; but, it may be feared, that the most <hi>near immediate signs, and premonitions of impendent Judgment,</hi> as to the <hi>Churches of Britain and Ireland,</hi> are in a great measure <hi>past,</hi> and have discharged their <hi>Commission,</hi> without any suitable regard thereof; yea, that there may <hi>be little, either of Faith, or Fear, when it comes;</hi> and I must judge, if a <hi>clear view</hi> were this day of all these <hi>extraordinary Monitory signs and warnings, which in</hi> 30 <hi>years past</hi> have been given to awake these <hi>Nations of England and Scotland,</hi> with the most convincing evidence, were now, at once, set in our sight, it might have a strange astonishing aspect, as no thing but a <hi>mortal Lethargy</hi> could take off the sense, and impression thereof off Mens Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is yet one <hi>Reference</hi> farther on such a <hi>Subject,</hi> I may be needful to make; <hi>What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect can the intent of such an extraordinary call
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:205487:142"/>have, for as to make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before the Lord, for a Nation,</hi> as that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30, when nothing, in a Moral way, seems to work this day; and Divine warnings tend only to be a publick Theme of derision yea, a dispensation of <hi>Miracles,</hi> were it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth now, would be, to appearance, little operative, or convincing with most: yet does this no way take off the evidence, and urgency of such a <hi>Call</hi> to our case, wherewith, as Men may see a <hi>lovely condecency to the gracious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and excellencies of our God, in a Judiciary procedure with a Nation,</hi> that has been so dear, and beloved of him; it is directed to witness, what regard he hath to <hi>one</hi> such, who is of a more <hi>raised spirit,</hi> than others, for the <hi>vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his glory,</hi> and the publick Interest and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Land,</hi> wherein they are, when it's like to perish, and what room <hi>one example</hi> of such <hi>may have in a restoring and saving work</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> in such a place; yea thus how valuable with him <hi>these</hi> are by whose <hi>example,</hi> the <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>veneration of God</hi> is kept up with lustre and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, amidst a perverse Generation; it's to shew, also, where <hi>Judgment</hi> is not absolutely determined, in what a measure the <hi>Spirit of Faith,</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> may be let forth to some of his Saints in an extraordinary time, to make way for his acceptance of a Few, in behalf of a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and to witness to the World the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

               <p>VVHen there is such cause to fear the outgoings of <hi>Divine Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> in some unusual manner, it should be a hopeful and promising <hi>Sign,</hi> if a <hi>higher study were, to meet God in the way of mercy,</hi> and for paying in some more suitable <hi>tribute of the Glory of his Works,</hi> in the Service of Gratitude: that the <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of these nations,</hi> hath, in this respect, been something extraordinary, with a most singular call to an <hi>admiring and observing work, upon the great acts of Divine Providence,</hi> and so unusual a <hi>conjunction</hi> herein, above all natural causes, is unquestionable; but for what account can be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:205487:143"/>given on the improvement hereof, seems not onely to be a <hi>hiding of the same under the ground,</hi> for the most part, but that the Spirit of this <hi>Age,</hi> is, in a strange manner, at work, how to darken, so far as possible, the most eminent, and immediate Discoveries of God, unto Men, in the way of Providence, and to subject his <hi>works,</hi> as well as his <hi>word,</hi> to their reason, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone influence of <hi>second causes.</hi> But if it be truly sought this day to have <hi>God propitious</hi> to <hi>these nations,</hi> and to serve the end of such great Providences, as have been, of late, towards the same; this <hi>Study</hi> will have another weight upon Men's Spirit, about which I would offer <hi>a few things,</hi> with a <hi>humble reference to such as are under the highest trust,</hi> and of the greatest capacity to promote such a <hi>Service,</hi> wherein the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and <hi>the strength, and standing of the State of Britain,</hi> is so nearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested. 1. if a <hi>publick return, and oblation of praise,</hi> upon any eminent acts of Providence and deliverance to a <hi>nation,</hi> which are of a <hi>natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal extent,</hi> can be seriously designed for such an end, where there is not here, with the same <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick care</hi> extended, to have such singular passages of Providence sought out, and considered under these <hi>circumstances,</hi> as may be most convincing, and <hi>demonstrative of God herein;</hi> and to have such a <hi>venerable remembrance</hi> keeped up of the same, with the highest honour, as may not be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:205487:144"/>bounded with the transient work of a <hi>Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving day,</hi> which had so great a weight still with the <hi>Church under the Old Testament,</hi> in any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular cases of Providence, and is of the same <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and perpetual use, in <hi>these times</hi> we are now in. 2. Should it nor be justly expected, on a suitable return, and <hi>retribution of Praises, by the complex Body of a nation,</hi> and the <hi>Rulers</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, upon any great, and marvellous works of God, for their Security and Deliverance, that they be reckoned of such value, as <hi>a national Interest,</hi> and as illustrious, and <hi>publick monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Divine Providence; yea, that a <hi>Book and register of remembrance of this kind,</hi> be of that weight, as to come under the <hi>Publick care of Civil Authority, as a national Record,</hi> which I doubt not, in these latter times, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>growing glory of Christ</hi>'s <hi>visible Kingdom</hi> in the World, will be reckoned amongst the highest <hi>publick concerns of nations,</hi> and of the <hi>Churches of Christ</hi> to bring up, what hath been wanting, and detain'd of such a <hi>rent,</hi> and <hi>Tribute of praise unto God,</hi> upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Works. 3. Since the credit, and weight of such a <hi>Service,</hi> for keeping up the highest respect to such great acts, and passages of Providence, as relate to a particular Church and State, depends on the most <hi>exact inquiry, and search</hi> upon the <hi>evidence</hi> hereof, and of the more immediate appearance, and <hi>signature of a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:205487:144"/>Divine power</hi> thereon; it should be most convincing for such an end, and stands to the highest reason, if a <hi>trust</hi> of that weight, be by a <hi>publick care, and commitment,</hi> just under their hand, whose <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and judiciousness</hi> might be most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing for such an intent, and of having no <hi>partial respect, or end</hi> herein, but only for the <hi>honour, and exalting of God, and strengthning men in the Christian Faith,</hi> by so great a <hi>Seal</hi> thereto, and for the interest of the <hi>Posterity;</hi> wherein, I doubt not, but these who may be at the greatest advantage herein, though, in some lesser differences of Judgment they should not so fully meet, yet under such <hi>excitements,</hi> of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice so <hi>highly honourable for God, and publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of their Generation,</hi> would intirely unite for promoting the same. 4. And it may be judged, if the <hi>honor of God,</hi> and of <hi>his works,</hi> with the true interest of the <hi>Succeeding Race,</hi> have a weight on this <hi>Age,</hi> that it's one of the highest <hi>national concerns</hi> this day, to have the <hi>credit of Tradition, and conveyance of these more illustrious acts of Providence,</hi> which have been in this time taken, under a publick care; the sad want, and defect of which, for having so great an <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>treasure</hi> thus secured, and keeped clear to succeeding times, hath been one of the great prejudices to the Truth, and advance of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in the World; and now in a time of such <hi>fears,</hi> as to what may be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:205487:145"/>yet coming on the Earth, and <hi>on such a part of the same;</hi> I should with assurance hope, that such a <hi>study,</hi> may have some <hi>peculiar Seal, and testimony of Divine respect</hi> following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and, a <hi>Record of that nature,</hi> design'd, and promoted by <hi>Civil Authority,</hi> should have yet <hi>more eminent,</hi> and <hi>signal providences of mercy given for filling up of the same,</hi> to make that <hi>Promise</hi> good, how such as are faithful to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</hi> and <hi>record</hi> lesser things, shall have yet more on a <hi>national interest</hi> added, yea, from thence <hi>date</hi> convincing evidences of his respects, when it is purely designed for <hi>God,</hi> and to keep up the honour of his Name in such an <hi>Atheistick Age.</hi>
